1
00:00:02,104 --> 00:00:04,538
("Ain't No Rest for the Wicked"
by Cage the Elephant playing)

2
00:00:13,831 --> 00:00:15,287
 I was walking
down the street 

3
00:00:15,322 --> 00:00:16,921
 When out the corner
of my eye 

4
00:00:16,956 --> 00:00:19,933
 I saw a pretty little thing
approaching me 

5
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:21,772
 She said,
"I never seen a man 

6
00:00:21,807 --> 00:00:22,945
 "Who looked so all alone 

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,103
 Oh, could you use
a little company?" 

8
00:00:26,138 --> 00:00:29,045
 Not even 15 minutes later, I'm
still walking down the street 

9
00:00:29,134 --> 00:00:32,234
 When I saw the shadow of a man
creep out of sight 

10
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:33,800
 And then he swept up
from behind 

11
00:00:33,835 --> 00:00:35,263
 He put a gun up to my head 

12
00:00:35,305 --> 00:00:38,286
 He made it clear he wasn't
looking for a fight 

13
00:00:38,391 --> 00:00:39,944
 He said,
"Give me all you got 

14
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:41,531
 "I want your money,
not your life 

15
00:00:41,566 --> 00:00:42,924
-  But if you try to make a move,
- (siren wailing)

16
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,523
I won't think twice" 

17
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:46,129
 I told him,
"You can have my cash 

18
00:00:46,164 --> 00:00:47,519
 "But first you know
I got to ask 

19
00:00:47,593 --> 00:00:50,674
 What made you want to live
this kind of life?" 

20
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:53,960
 He said there ain't no rest
for the wicked 

21
00:00:54,081 --> 00:00:56,794
 Money don't grow on trees 

22
00:00:56,829 --> 00:00:58,636
 I got bills to pay,
I got mouths to feed 

23
00:00:58,711 --> 00:01:00,409
Turn the music
down, sir.

24
00:01:00,444 --> 00:01:02,344
 There ain't nothing
in this world for free... 

25
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:04,813
Hey, cut the music.

26
00:01:04,848 --> 00:01:06,448
(chuckling):
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,883
(music volume decreases)

28
00:01:07,918 --> 00:01:09,451
You know why I pulled you over?

29
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,920
Well, obviously, you felt
the need to exercise

30
00:01:11,955 --> 00:01:13,622
your limited powers
and punish me

31
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:15,123
for ignoring
the speed limit.

32
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:17,492
It's okay. I understand.

33
00:01:17,528 --> 00:01:19,828
I-I like to punish people, too.

34
00:01:19,863 --> 00:01:21,329
Or at least I used to.

35
00:01:21,365 --> 00:01:23,665
License and
registration.

36
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,467
(sighs)
Coming right up.

37
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,035
 Man creep out of sight 

38
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,670
 And then he swept up... 

39
00:01:28,705 --> 00:01:31,106
Are you trying
to bribe me, sir?

40
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:32,450
Yes, of course.

41
00:01:32,485 --> 00:01:35,343
 He said,
"Give me all you got..." 

42
00:01:35,379 --> 00:01:36,344
Is that not enough?

43
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,447
Take more. It's only money.

44
00:01:38,482 --> 00:01:39,948
It's against
the law, sir.

45
00:01:39,983 --> 00:01:42,904
(chuckles) You people are funny
about your laws, aren't you?

46
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,988
You break the law sometimes,
don't you?

47
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:49,424
 I said, "You're such
a sweet young thing..." 

48
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,026
Sometimes...

49
00:01:51,061 --> 00:01:53,028
I put my siren on
and drive really fast

50
00:01:53,063 --> 00:01:54,696
for no reason at all,

51
00:01:54,731 --> 00:01:56,231
just 'cause I can.

52
00:01:56,266 --> 00:01:57,232
Right?

53
00:01:57,267 --> 00:01:58,800
And why wouldn't you? It's fun.

54
00:01:58,836 --> 00:02:01,203
It feels good to get away
with something, doesn't it?

55
00:02:01,238 --> 00:02:03,305
Yeah.

56
00:02:04,908 --> 00:02:07,042
Uh, it's okay,
Officer.

57
00:02:07,077 --> 00:02:08,477
People like to tell me things,

58
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:12,581
those deep, dark, naughty little
desires that are on their mind.

59
00:02:12,616 --> 00:02:14,282
It's a gift.

60
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:16,184
Must be something
about this face.

61
00:02:17,354 --> 00:02:18,854
You're tempted
to keep that, aren't you?

62
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:21,156
Well, what are you
waiting for, permission?

63
00:02:21,191 --> 00:02:23,225
Go on, take it, buy yourself
something pretty.

64
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,359
You deserve it.

65
00:02:26,163 --> 00:02:28,864
But if you don't mind,
I really must be on my way.

66
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:30,532
Oh, yeah, of course.

67
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,934
Hey, have a nice evening.

68
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,770
You, too, Officer.

69
00:02:35,806 --> 00:02:37,339
- You, too.
- (music volume increases)

70
00:02:37,374 --> 00:02:40,001
 "You can have my cash, but
first you know I got to ask 

71
00:02:40,036 --> 00:02:42,932
 What made you want to live
this kind of life?" 

72
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:46,448
 He said there ain't no rest
for the wicked 

73
00:02:46,483 --> 00:02:49,037
 Money don't grow on trees 

74
00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:52,274
 I got bills to pay,
I got mouths to feed 

75
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:55,306
 There ain't nothing
in this world for free 

76
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,554
 Oh, no, there ain't
no rest for the wicked 

77
00:02:58,589 --> 00:03:01,443
-  Until we close our eyes for good. 
- Hey, boss.

78
00:03:01,478 --> 00:03:04,546
("Fame" by David Bowie playing)

79
00:03:10,741 --> 00:03:16,144
 Fame makes a man
take things over 

80
00:03:16,179 --> 00:03:21,490
 Fame lets him loose,
hard to swallow 

81
00:03:21,525 --> 00:03:26,537
 Fame puts you there
where things are hollow 

82
00:03:26,572 --> 00:03:29,157
 Fame... 

83
00:03:29,192 --> 00:03:31,026
Where have you been?

84
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:32,610
Oh, holed up
in a château,

85
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:34,930
copulating with a young
woman named Faith.

86
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,298
It's ironic, isn't it?

87
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:39,601
Thank you, Patrick.
You can go.

88
00:03:42,406 --> 00:03:43,705
(chuckles)

89
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,240
You little devil.

90
00:03:45,275 --> 00:03:46,274
What?

91
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,043
I dropped something.

92
00:03:48,078 --> 00:03:49,678
Well, I'm sure you did.

93
00:03:49,713 --> 00:03:52,714
Now, Lucifer,
I am a big fan of sex.

94
00:03:52,749 --> 00:03:53,782
Obviously.

95
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:56,685
But I didn't leave Hell
to be a bartender.

96
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,687
Shouldn't you be spending
your valuable time

97
00:03:58,722 --> 00:04:01,957
doing something
more significant?

98
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,172
(scoffs)

99
00:04:03,207 --> 00:04:05,927
You're the lord of Hell,
for crying out loud.

100
00:04:05,963 --> 00:04:08,296
I am retired, Maze.
I've got nothing but time.

101
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:09,731
Thank you.

102
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:15,470
(music plays in slow motion)

103
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:22,377
(echoing):
<i> Fame, fame...</i> 

104
00:04:22,412 --> 00:04:24,980
I think you have a visitor.

105
00:04:31,321 --> 00:04:32,111
(sighs)

106
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:35,097
Amenadiel,
how's it hanging, big guy?

107
00:04:35,132 --> 00:04:36,169
Huh?

108
00:04:36,482 --> 00:04:39,894
Your return to the Underworld
has been requested.

109
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,731
Oh, right, okay.

110
00:04:41,766 --> 00:04:43,483
Let me just, uh,
check my calendar.

111
00:04:43,518 --> 00:04:45,100
Yeah, here it is.

112
00:04:45,135 --> 00:04:47,068
Uh, the seventh of never

113
00:04:47,104 --> 00:04:49,004
through to the 15th
of ain't-gonna-happen.

114
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,572
How does that work
for you guys?

115
00:04:50,607 --> 00:04:51,914
(sighs)

116
00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:54,574
Look, remind Dad
that I quit Hell

117
00:04:54,609 --> 00:04:57,112
because I was sick and tired
of playing a part in his play.

118
00:04:57,147 --> 00:04:58,313
I'm gonna warn you

119
00:04:58,348 --> 00:04:59,881
against disrespecting
our father, Lucifer.

120
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,583
Yeah, well, our father's
been disrespecting me

121
00:05:01,618 --> 00:05:02,784
since the beginning of time,

122
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:05,320
so pot-kettle, don't you think?

123
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:09,090
You are a mockery of
everything divine.

124
00:05:09,126 --> 00:05:10,925
Thank you.

125
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:13,928
Thank you, but lately I've been
doing a fair amount of thinking.

126
00:05:13,964 --> 00:05:15,930
Now, do you think
I'm the Devil

127
00:05:15,966 --> 00:05:17,232
because I'm inherently evil,

128
00:05:17,267 --> 00:05:19,901
just because dear old Dad
decided I was?

129
00:05:19,936 --> 00:05:21,036
What exactly do
you think happens

130
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,137
when the Devil
leaves Hell?

131
00:05:22,172 --> 00:05:23,963
(scoffs)

132
00:05:23,998 --> 00:05:26,007
All of those demons,

133
00:05:26,043 --> 00:05:29,210
all of those tormented
and tortured souls,

134
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:30,578
where do you think they go?

135
00:05:30,614 --> 00:05:33,982
Don't know, don't care.

136
00:05:34,017 --> 00:05:35,216
Not my problem, brother.

137
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:38,353
So consider the position
officially open.

138
00:05:39,623 --> 00:05:41,923
And you, my feathered friend,
can go to Hell.

139
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,726
(chuckles)

140
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,328
Yeah, try it.

141
00:05:47,364 --> 00:05:49,764
You think Father's upset now.

142
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,599
(chuckles)

143
00:05:54,571 --> 00:05:59,007
You know, he will not be
merciful for much longer.

144
00:06:05,649 --> 00:06:07,749
(music resumes at normal tempo)

145
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,261
Hey, you.

146
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,763
Remember me?

147
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,332
- You're famous, aren't you?
- GIRL: Delilah!

148
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:26,933
- LUCIFER: Delilah, isn't it?
- GIRL: I love you, Delilah!

149
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:28,603
Can I have your autograph?

150
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,306
(chuckles)
If I can have a drink.

151
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:33,775
LUCIFER: So are you gonna tell
me why you really came back?

152
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,910
There's something
I need to know.

153
00:06:35,946 --> 00:06:37,412
And what's that?

154
00:06:37,447 --> 00:06:41,449
Did I... sell my soul
to the Devil?

155
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:44,018
(chuckles)
Well, that would imply

156
00:06:44,054 --> 00:06:44,986
the Devil's actually
interested in your soul.

157
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:48,356
Look, all I did
was introduce you

158
00:06:48,391 --> 00:06:50,792
to a few key people who
owed me favors, that's all.

159
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:54,028
I mean, with all the good
came a hell of a lot of bad.

160
00:06:54,064 --> 00:06:56,631
Oh, right, so the Devil
made you do it, did he?

161
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,000
The alcohol and the drugs,
the topless selfies.

162
00:06:59,035 --> 00:07:00,769
The choices are
on you, my dear.

163
00:07:00,804 --> 00:07:02,737
I mean, Jimmy Barnes?

164
00:07:02,773 --> 00:07:05,406
I can't believe you almost
married that sweaty little imp.

165
00:07:05,442 --> 00:07:06,407
He produced my album.

166
00:07:06,443 --> 00:07:07,809
You introduced me to him.

167
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,878
I suggested you work with him,
not sleep with him.

168
00:07:09,913 --> 00:07:11,412
Well, I got confused.

169
00:07:11,448 --> 00:07:12,580
And then you left him
at the altar.

170
00:07:12,616 --> 00:07:13,815
Yeah, that was rude of me.

171
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,150
No, actually, I quite
enjoyed that bit.

172
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,451
(both chuckle)

173
00:07:16,486 --> 00:07:18,686
You know, he trapped me
in the bathroom at the Grammys,

174
00:07:18,722 --> 00:07:20,054
said he wanted
to get back together.

175
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,122
Then I hear he's marrying

176
00:07:21,158 --> 00:07:22,690
a supermodel...
this weekend.

177
00:07:22,726 --> 00:07:24,359
And I'm jealous.

178
00:07:24,394 --> 00:07:26,928
Oh, God, I'm a mess.

179
00:07:26,963 --> 00:07:29,097
God has nothing to
do with your mess.

180
00:07:29,132 --> 00:07:30,832
Look...

181
00:07:32,102 --> 00:07:35,069
You didn't sell
your soul, Delilah.

182
00:07:35,105 --> 00:07:36,504
You do owe me a favor.

183
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,206
I'm scared.

184
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:39,641
You should be.

185
00:07:39,676 --> 00:07:40,975
Because what
I'm about to ask you

186
00:07:41,011 --> 00:07:42,544
is gonna be
quite difficult for you.

187
00:07:43,947 --> 00:07:45,847
Pull yourself together.

188
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,683
That's it, that's
all I'm asking.

189
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,820
'Cause you're wasting
your talent, your life.

190
00:07:51,855 --> 00:07:54,222
Hmm?

191
00:07:56,293 --> 00:07:58,860
You're human, darling.
(chuckles)

192
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,095
I'm gonna do
as you asked.

193
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:03,498
I'm gonna get
it together.

194
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:05,800
Promise, Lucifer.

195
00:08:05,836 --> 00:08:07,735
Look, it's not about me.

196
00:08:07,771 --> 00:08:11,206
What happens now,
that's up to you.

197
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,575
- Okay?
- Yeah.

198
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,043
Come here, you.

199
00:08:17,948 --> 00:08:19,247
(tires squealing)

200
00:08:33,997 --> 00:08:36,097
(gasps)

201
00:08:56,152 --> 00:08:58,275
Oh, no, no, no, not yet.

202
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,888
(gasps)

203
00:08:59,923 --> 00:09:01,155
What did you do?

204
00:09:01,191 --> 00:09:02,690
I'm sorry.

205
00:09:02,726 --> 00:09:04,692
"Sorry."

206
00:09:04,728 --> 00:09:06,794
Why did you end her life?

207
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,830
Why else?

208
00:09:08,865 --> 00:09:10,265
Money.

209
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,233
"Money."

210
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:15,603
Oh, it's times like this
I wish I was still in Hell.

211
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:18,907
All the fun activities
I'd have planned for you.

212
00:09:18,942 --> 00:09:21,476
Hey, man, I just
pulled the trigger.

213
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,414
(gasps, exhales weakly)

214
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:32,587
(siren wails in distance)

215
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,266
(helicopter whirring)

216
00:09:45,302 --> 00:09:47,936
 

217
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:54,375
(indistinct chatter)

218
00:09:54,411 --> 00:09:57,412
(siren whooping)

219
00:10:04,554 --> 00:10:06,821
(camera beeping, clicking)

220
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,757
(sirens whooping)

221
00:10:12,295 --> 00:10:14,495
MAN: Want to hear
what I've got so far?

222
00:10:16,766 --> 00:10:18,833
Lieutenant said
this is my case.

223
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,703
Yeah, Chloe,
it is your case,

224
00:10:21,738 --> 00:10:23,338
but try not to take
too much time.

225
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:24,572
It's an easy one.

226
00:10:24,607 --> 00:10:25,773
That's our bad guy.

227
00:10:25,809 --> 00:10:28,977
Eddie Deacon, he's
a low-level drug dealer.

228
00:10:29,012 --> 00:10:30,411
I found these in his pocket,

229
00:10:30,447 --> 00:10:32,447
and I found this
in Delilah's purse,

230
00:10:32,482 --> 00:10:33,781
so obviously drug-related.

231
00:10:33,817 --> 00:10:35,783
She probably owed him
a bunch of cash or something.

232
00:10:35,819 --> 00:10:38,419
She's not exactly selling out
stadiums these days.

233
00:10:38,455 --> 00:10:39,587
How do you know
he's low-level?

234
00:10:39,622 --> 00:10:41,689
Look at his car.

235
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,391
Did you look at his watch?

236
00:10:43,426 --> 00:10:44,425
That thing ain't cheap.

237
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:46,461
MAN:
It's probably fake.

238
00:10:46,496 --> 00:10:48,363
Look...

239
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:51,466
there's gonna be a lot of
attention on this one, Chloe.

240
00:10:51,501 --> 00:10:53,434
I wouldn't pick at it too hard.

241
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,069
Not after Palmetto Street.

242
00:10:55,105 --> 00:10:58,206
I asked for this case
because of Palmetto Street, Dan.

243
00:10:59,364 --> 00:11:02,377
So, anyway, any witnesses?

244
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:05,179
LUCIFER:
Lucifer Morningstar.

245
00:11:05,215 --> 00:11:07,849
"Lucifer
Morningstar"?

246
00:11:07,884 --> 00:11:10,885
Is that, uh,
a stage name or something?

247
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,754
(chuckles)
God-given, I'm afraid.

248
00:11:12,789 --> 00:11:13,988
You know,

249
00:11:14,024 --> 00:11:15,056
you look familiar.

250
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,324
Have we met before?

251
00:11:16,359 --> 00:11:19,060
Yeah, five minutes ago.

252
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,294
And I'm asking the questions.

253
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,031
Talk to me about your
relationship with the victim.

254
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:25,466
Well, she used to work here
a few years back.

255
00:11:25,502 --> 00:11:27,969
I would occasionally
accompany her while she sang.

256
00:11:28,004 --> 00:11:31,406
Then she became a big star and
someone decided to end her life.

257
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:32,673
Do you know the shooter?

258
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:34,876
No, but we did have
an interesting little chat

259
00:11:34,911 --> 00:11:36,911
just before he kicked off.

260
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,047
I asked him why he did it.

261
00:11:39,082 --> 00:11:41,099
Huh, like to play cop, do you?

262
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:41,816
(laughs)

263
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:44,018
No, I just like to play
in general, Detective.

264
00:11:44,054 --> 00:11:45,787
What about you?

265
00:11:45,822 --> 00:11:48,856
So, you had a conversation
with a dead guy?

266
00:11:48,892 --> 00:11:50,158
Oh, no, he wasn't quite dead.

267
00:11:50,193 --> 00:11:51,934
His soul hadn't
crossed the threshold.

268
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:55,129
I see.
Did he tell you why he did it?

269
00:11:55,165 --> 00:11:56,998
Why, money, of course.

270
00:11:57,033 --> 00:11:59,267
You humans, you love your money,
don't you?

271
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,902
Yes.

272
00:12:00,937 --> 00:12:02,270
Yes, we do.

273
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,405
And, uh, what planet
are you from... London?

274
00:12:04,441 --> 00:12:05,640
(laughs)

275
00:12:05,675 --> 00:12:08,176
Yes, he also said,
"I just pulled the trigger."

276
00:12:08,211 --> 00:12:10,578
Now, don't you think
that's interesting?

277
00:12:10,613 --> 00:12:12,680
Delilah was shot to death
by a drug dealer.

278
00:12:12,715 --> 00:12:15,683
And looks like Delilah herself
kept the guy pretty busy.

279
00:12:15,718 --> 00:12:18,252
You know, it's sad, it's ugly,
but it's not rocket science.

280
00:12:18,288 --> 00:12:20,121
Something probably
went south between them.

281
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,089
She gets riddled with bullets,

282
00:12:21,124 --> 00:12:23,391
and a nice little act of God
takes him out.

283
00:12:23,426 --> 00:12:25,460
You know, it doesn't work
like that, Detective.

284
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,361
It's quite a neatly wrapped
little present

285
00:12:27,397 --> 00:12:28,896
for the LAPD, don't you think?

286
00:12:28,932 --> 00:12:30,698
Why don't you tell me something?

287
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:32,166
How does she end up

288
00:12:32,202 --> 00:12:33,434
dying in a hailstorm of bullets,

289
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,203
and you get away
without a scratch?

290
00:12:35,238 --> 00:12:36,971
I think that's interesting.
Don't you?

291
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,272
The benefits of immortality.

292
00:12:38,308 --> 00:12:39,407
"Immortality."

293
00:12:39,442 --> 00:12:40,441
Mm, of course, uh,

294
00:12:40,477 --> 00:12:42,376
you spell that
with one or two M's?

295
00:12:42,412 --> 00:12:43,711
I always forget.

296
00:12:43,746 --> 00:12:46,280
What will your corrupt little
organization do about this?

297
00:12:46,316 --> 00:12:48,483
Excuse me?

298
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:49,984
Will you find
the person responsible?

299
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,085
Will they be punished?

300
00:12:51,121 --> 00:12:52,653
Will this be a priority for you?

301
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,322
Because it is for me.

302
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:55,957
You got some balls
on you, pal.

303
00:12:55,992 --> 00:12:58,292
Oh, thank you very much, but
they're really quite average.

304
00:12:58,328 --> 00:12:59,594
I bet.

305
00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:01,429
Now, are you sure
that we haven't met?

306
00:13:01,464 --> 00:13:03,698
I could swear
I've seen you naked.

307
00:13:03,733 --> 00:13:04,632
Have we had sex?

308
00:13:06,136 --> 00:13:07,935
We're done here.

309
00:13:07,971 --> 00:13:08,836
Uh, Detective, wait!

310
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:10,304
Someone out there
needs to be punished.

311
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,840
- We're not done.
- Yeah. Yeah, we are.

312
00:13:19,968 --> 00:13:22,835
 

313
00:13:25,953 --> 00:13:29,609
 Once in the evening 

314
00:13:29,724 --> 00:13:31,649
 There was harmony... 

315
00:13:31,684 --> 00:13:34,633
If there is anyone here that
would oppose this holy union,

316
00:13:34,669 --> 00:13:36,368
speak now or forever
hold your peace.

317
00:13:36,404 --> 00:13:38,470
Excuse me. Yeah,
I have a problem.

318
00:13:38,506 --> 00:13:40,839
Has-has anyone else noticed

319
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,341
how incredibly, jaw-droppingly,

320
00:13:42,376 --> 00:13:44,710
loin-stirringly beautiful
this young woman is

321
00:13:44,745 --> 00:13:46,412
and how short, sweaty

322
00:13:46,447 --> 00:13:48,781
and altogether fugly
this homunculus is?

323
00:13:48,816 --> 00:13:50,849
I mean, what is this...
a wedding or a kidnapping?

324
00:13:50,885 --> 00:13:52,217
Do you know what I mean?

325
00:13:53,988 --> 00:13:55,721
Yeah, good luck
with that, Padre.

326
00:13:55,756 --> 00:13:57,289
Ooh, why you're at it,
say hey for me.

327
00:13:57,325 --> 00:13:59,491
It's been a while.
(chuckles)

328
00:13:59,527 --> 00:14:01,060
Jimmy Barnes!

329
00:14:01,095 --> 00:14:01,994
Remember me?

330
00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:03,595
Hey, man,
this is a private event.

331
00:14:03,631 --> 00:14:04,863
How did you get in here?

332
00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:06,065
Yeah, and quite a lavish one

333
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,567
for a record producer
on the outs.

334
00:14:08,602 --> 00:14:10,169
You do remember me, don't you?

335
00:14:10,204 --> 00:14:11,704
Yeah, yeah, I remember you.

336
00:14:11,739 --> 00:14:14,173
Now, what do you want?
I'm a little busy.

337
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:16,442
Well, I can't believe
that you're getting married

338
00:14:16,477 --> 00:14:19,111
the day after your ex-fiancée
and once brightest star

339
00:14:19,146 --> 00:14:20,879
was murdered in cold blood.

340
00:14:20,915 --> 00:14:22,381
JIMMY: Yeah,
that's very sad.

341
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,483
But you know what,
she ruined my wedding once.

342
00:14:24,518 --> 00:14:26,185
I'm not about to let
that happen again.

343
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,853
It's hard to be rejected,
isn't it, Jimmy?

344
00:14:27,888 --> 00:14:29,121
Twice.
(chuckles)

345
00:14:29,156 --> 00:14:30,289
JIMMY:
What?

346
00:14:30,324 --> 00:14:31,924
Well, you tried
to get her back recently.

347
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:33,726
I mean, I'd kill someone
if they denied me once.

348
00:14:33,761 --> 00:14:35,027
Not that that's possible.

349
00:14:35,062 --> 00:14:37,830
So, come on,
what do you say, Jimbo, huh?

350
00:14:37,865 --> 00:14:39,398
Did you want her dead?

351
00:14:39,433 --> 00:14:42,234
Look, stop looking at me
that way, you freak.

352
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:44,303
I am not playing that
mind game with you.

353
00:14:44,338 --> 00:14:45,471
No, of course not!

354
00:14:45,506 --> 00:14:46,872
I was furious and
I was humiliated

355
00:14:46,907 --> 00:14:49,174
when she dumped me,
but I think, I-I think

356
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,876
I've rebounded pretty well.

357
00:14:50,911 --> 00:14:53,045
Yes, clearly.
Respect.

358
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,947
JIMMY: Should go
play your mind games

359
00:14:54,982 --> 00:14:56,081
with 2Vile.

360
00:14:56,117 --> 00:14:57,750
- The rapper?
- Come on.

361
00:14:57,785 --> 00:14:59,551
Delilah dumped me
for that lunatic.

362
00:14:59,587 --> 00:15:00,853
They were always fighting.

363
00:15:00,888 --> 00:15:02,187
He slapped her
around a bunch.

364
00:15:02,223 --> 00:15:04,723
He surrounds himself with
gun-toting morons 24-7.

365
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:06,692
He is the real deal.

366
00:15:06,727 --> 00:15:08,560
Right.

367
00:15:09,497 --> 00:15:10,763
Sorry, how rude.

368
00:15:10,798 --> 00:15:12,664
Allow me to introduce myself.

369
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,534
Lucifer Morningstar.

370
00:15:15,569 --> 00:15:18,637
I really don't want to
have sex with him tonight.

371
00:15:18,672 --> 00:15:20,606
(congregation gasping)

372
00:15:20,641 --> 00:15:22,441
Oh, my...

373
00:15:22,476 --> 00:15:23,575
I'm sorry, I...

374
00:15:23,611 --> 00:15:25,044
I can't believe
I just said that.

375
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:26,879
LUCIFER: Oh, no, no, no.
Let's be honest here.

376
00:15:26,914 --> 00:15:28,881
I mean, you're not
marrying this human stain

377
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,916
'cause you're actually
in love with him, right?

378
00:15:30,951 --> 00:15:32,284
- God no.
- No.

379
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:33,419
Right.

380
00:15:33,454 --> 00:15:34,887
(claps)
Well, I should get going.

381
00:15:34,922 --> 00:15:36,221
Ooh!

382
00:15:36,257 --> 00:15:38,590
Best of luck
with you crazy kids, all right?

383
00:15:38,626 --> 00:15:40,667
("Devil's Haircut" by Beck
playing)

384
00:15:40,702 --> 00:15:44,337
 Something's wrong
'cause my mind is fading 

385
00:15:44,465 --> 00:15:48,434
 And everywhere I look,
there's a dead end waiting 

386
00:15:48,569 --> 00:15:52,371
 Temperature's dropping
at the rotten oasis 

387
00:15:52,406 --> 00:15:53,919
- (doorbell rings)
-  Stealing kisses from

388
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:56,462
the leperous faces... 

389
00:15:56,844 --> 00:15:58,310
Good afternoon, sir.

390
00:15:58,345 --> 00:15:59,812
Yes, I'm here to see the man

391
00:15:59,847 --> 00:16:01,513
sadly known as 2Vile...
is he in?

392
00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:03,549
I'm sorry, sir.
He's unavailable.

393
00:16:03,584 --> 00:16:05,084
He's in mourning, I'm afraid.

394
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:08,000
Right.
I have narcotics for him.

395
00:16:08,355 --> 00:16:10,355
Right this way, sir.

396
00:16:10,391 --> 00:16:13,602
 Hold up, it's the game,
it chose us 

397
00:16:13,637 --> 00:16:16,801
 Pioneers started on my corner
like the Cold Crush 

398
00:16:16,836 --> 00:16:19,965
 Had smokers lining up
the block like a gold rush... 

399
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,234
Here you go, baby.

400
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:25,571
Can someone please turn down
this god-awful music!

401
00:16:25,606 --> 00:16:26,738
Hello, disc jockey!

402
00:16:26,774 --> 00:16:28,674
Thank you.

403
00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:30,242
Who's this clown?

404
00:16:30,277 --> 00:16:32,344
He has narcotics
for you, sir.

405
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:35,514
My name is Lucifer Morningstar.

406
00:16:35,549 --> 00:16:37,616
"Lucifer Morningstar"?

407
00:16:37,651 --> 00:16:39,084
(laughs)

408
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,919
Now, that's a good hip-hop name.

409
00:16:40,955 --> 00:16:42,221
Well, that offends me.

410
00:16:42,256 --> 00:16:45,424
What, you don't like hip-hop?

411
00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:46,925
No, I most certainly do not.

412
00:16:46,961 --> 00:16:49,728
Well, that offends me.

413
00:16:51,732 --> 00:16:54,166
You have a problem
with black people?

414
00:16:54,201 --> 00:16:55,367
No, not in the slightest.

415
00:16:55,402 --> 00:16:56,468
I just hate your music.

416
00:16:56,504 --> 00:16:58,203
- (laughs)
- And when I say

417
00:16:58,239 --> 00:16:59,705
"your music,"
I mean<i> your</i> music.

418
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,440
Not the music made
by other black people.

419
00:17:01,475 --> 00:17:04,476
Without the blues, there'd be
no devil's music whatsoever.

420
00:17:04,512 --> 00:17:06,478
There are, of course,
many giants in the field.

421
00:17:06,514 --> 00:17:08,046
Just not you...
am I being clear?

422
00:17:08,082 --> 00:17:09,615
(chuckles) Yeah, you're
being clear all right.

423
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,717
- Good.
- If you're looking

424
00:17:11,752 --> 00:17:13,152
to get yourself killed.

425
00:17:13,187 --> 00:17:16,622
(guns clicking)

426
00:17:16,657 --> 00:17:18,824
Yes, well, don't waste
your munitions... I'm immortal.

427
00:17:19,693 --> 00:17:21,193
Tell me about Delilah.

428
00:17:21,228 --> 00:17:23,028
You ain't seen the news?

429
00:17:23,063 --> 00:17:24,830
Bitch is dead.

430
00:17:26,634 --> 00:17:28,233
(others gasping, murmuring)

431
00:17:28,269 --> 00:17:30,269
(gunshots)

432
00:17:31,972 --> 00:17:33,338
Don't shoot, you idiot!

433
00:17:34,575 --> 00:17:36,542
- I didn't kill her.
- Why should I believe you?

434
00:17:36,577 --> 00:17:38,243
Because I loved the girl.

435
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:40,279
People sometimes kill people
with whom they're in love.

436
00:17:40,314 --> 00:17:42,181
The heart's mysterious.

437
00:17:42,216 --> 00:17:43,949
- So I'm told.
- Ain't like that.

438
00:17:43,984 --> 00:17:46,318
Girl made me crazy!

439
00:17:46,353 --> 00:17:47,553
Women can do that.

440
00:17:47,588 --> 00:17:49,188
Doesn't mean you should
beat them up, does it?

441
00:17:49,223 --> 00:17:50,689
We worked that out
a long time ago.

442
00:17:50,724 --> 00:17:53,923
I hit her once 'cause I found
out she was cheating on me.

443
00:18:00,634 --> 00:18:01,800
All right.

444
00:18:01,835 --> 00:18:03,101
With whom?

445
00:18:03,137 --> 00:18:04,436
I don't know.
I don't know.

446
00:18:04,471 --> 00:18:05,837
She wouldn't tell me,
all right?

447
00:18:05,873 --> 00:18:07,139
Said it was a big secret,

448
00:18:07,174 --> 00:18:09,608
some-some, uh, rich married guy.

449
00:18:09,643 --> 00:18:11,510
Well, does she have a friend
that she might've confided in?

450
00:18:11,545 --> 00:18:12,844
She didn't trust no one, man.

451
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,413
Uh, uh, her therapist.

452
00:18:14,448 --> 00:18:16,215
Her therapist is probably
the only one who knows.

453
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,283
She-she's some, uh, uh,
Dr. Linda

454
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:19,418
in-in Beverly Hills.

455
00:18:19,453 --> 00:18:21,687
Saw her, like,
five times a week on the DL.

456
00:18:21,722 --> 00:18:23,589
Used a fake name, everything.

457
00:18:23,624 --> 00:18:25,791
Oh, did she now?

458
00:18:25,826 --> 00:18:28,527
Well, thank you for your time.

459
00:18:28,562 --> 00:18:31,063
CHLOE:
LAPD! Guns down.

460
00:18:31,098 --> 00:18:32,197
On the floor, down!

461
00:18:32,233 --> 00:18:33,665
You two against the wall.

462
00:18:33,701 --> 00:18:36,134
Detective, welcome to the party.

463
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,736
Grab the bucket,
collect the guns.

464
00:18:37,771 --> 00:18:39,638
Now!

465
00:18:39,673 --> 00:18:41,573
You sly dog,
you did listen to me.

466
00:18:41,609 --> 00:18:42,574
I ran the dead guy's cell phone.

467
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:43,842
2Vile was the last person
he called.

468
00:18:43,877 --> 00:18:45,811
Come on, man.

469
00:18:45,846 --> 00:18:47,980
What I find
highly interesting

470
00:18:48,015 --> 00:18:49,915
is how you made the
connection on your own.

471
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,617
Well, I've been busy, my dear.

472
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:53,719
Talk to me about Delilah.

473
00:18:53,754 --> 00:18:55,787
We've been over that one,
Detective.

474
00:18:55,823 --> 00:18:57,322
And why you called
the shooter

475
00:18:57,358 --> 00:18:58,790
two days before
she was murdered.

476
00:18:58,826 --> 00:19:01,560
Fine. Yeah, I called Eddie
'cause he hooks me up sometimes.

477
00:19:01,595 --> 00:19:02,961
He met Delilah through me.

478
00:19:02,997 --> 00:19:05,197
Whatever.
Don't make me a killer, do it?

479
00:19:05,232 --> 00:19:07,799
No, but it does
make you a suspect.

480
00:19:07,835 --> 00:19:10,168
What, so everyone on Eddie's
phone's a suspect?

481
00:19:10,204 --> 00:19:11,403
Are you joking?

482
00:19:11,438 --> 00:19:13,905
You gonna drag
half of Hollywood downtown.

483
00:19:13,941 --> 00:19:15,674
Be like the Oscars or something.

484
00:19:15,709 --> 00:19:18,076
Wait, aren't you
that chick from that film?

485
00:19:18,112 --> 00:19:19,611
Hmm, what's this?
What film?

486
00:19:19,647 --> 00:19:20,748
You used to be an actress
or something, right?

487
00:19:20,783 --> 00:19:21,553
Yeah.

488
00:19:21,588 --> 00:19:23,415
That teen movie...
I forget what it's called.

489
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:26,118
Of course.
<i>Hot Tub High School.</i>

490
00:19:26,153 --> 00:19:27,419
That's where
I know you from.

491
00:19:27,454 --> 00:19:29,021
Let's just stick to my
questions, shall we? So...

492
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:30,255
The one with
the famous nude scene,

493
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,456
coming out of the hot tub!

494
00:19:31,492 --> 00:19:33,358
It was, like, a complete
<i>Fast Times</i> rip-off.

495
00:19:33,394 --> 00:19:34,926
She was, like,
the new Phoebe Cates!

496
00:19:34,962 --> 00:19:36,395
Thanks, I appreciate that.

497
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,429
That was quite a nude scene.

498
00:19:37,464 --> 00:19:38,630
I have far too many bullets

499
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,032
in this thing
for you to still be talking.

500
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:41,933
You, we need to have a
conversation right now.

501
00:19:41,969 --> 00:19:43,402
LUCIFER: That's a waste
of time, Detective.

502
00:19:43,437 --> 00:19:45,304
I've just threatened his life...
he's not our guy.

503
00:19:45,339 --> 00:19:46,605
He would've said, trust me.

504
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,774
You did what?

505
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:50,909
Yeah, isn't that illegal?

506
00:19:50,944 --> 00:19:52,678
Uh, little bit, yeah.

507
00:19:52,713 --> 00:19:54,046
You stay put.

508
00:19:54,081 --> 00:19:55,247
You, you're coming with me.

509
00:19:55,282 --> 00:19:56,848
What? Ooh.
(laughs)

510
00:19:56,884 --> 00:19:58,583
With pleasure.

511
00:19:58,619 --> 00:20:00,452
At least, perhaps now,
you'll listen to me.

512
00:20:00,487 --> 00:20:02,788
Although, I'm not quite sure
why I'm being arrested.

513
00:20:02,823 --> 00:20:05,223
Because you're interfering
with a police investigation.

514
00:20:05,259 --> 00:20:07,693
You've broken I can't
even count how many laws.

515
00:20:07,728 --> 00:20:08,860
And you pissed me off.

516
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:10,395
Right, I can get
out of these, you know?

517
00:20:10,431 --> 00:20:11,663
Funny.

518
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,200
How'd you do that?

519
00:20:15,235 --> 00:20:16,501
(sighs)
Come on, we're wasting time.

520
00:20:16,537 --> 00:20:18,303
We should be out there
solving a homicide

521
00:20:18,339 --> 00:20:20,205
and punishing those responsible.

522
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,606
"We"?
You're insane.

523
00:20:21,642 --> 00:20:23,575
I'm taking you in.
Get in the car.

524
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:24,743
No, that's boring.

525
00:20:24,778 --> 00:20:25,911
Not to mention pointless.

526
00:20:25,946 --> 00:20:28,113
Come on, I'll help you.
It'll be fun.

527
00:20:28,148 --> 00:20:29,748
How could you possibly help me?

528
00:20:29,783 --> 00:20:31,016
I have a certain skill set.

529
00:20:31,051 --> 00:20:33,085
I can be very persuasive
with people

530
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,520
and tend to see things
that others cannot.

531
00:20:35,556 --> 00:20:37,289
So, you're psychic or something?

532
00:20:37,324 --> 00:20:39,758
No, I can't read people's minds.
I'm not a Jedi.

533
00:20:39,793 --> 00:20:41,326
People just like
to tell me things.

534
00:20:41,362 --> 00:20:43,095
Hmm, just-just tell you things?

535
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,763
Just confess their sins,
just like that?

536
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:45,864
No, not their sins.

537
00:20:45,899 --> 00:20:47,332
I have no power
over people's sins.

538
00:20:47,368 --> 00:20:49,034
I actually get
a bad rap for that.

539
00:20:49,069 --> 00:20:50,235
I have the ability

540
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:52,771
to draw out people's
forbidden desires.

541
00:20:52,806 --> 00:20:54,072
The more simple the human,

542
00:20:54,108 --> 00:20:55,273
the easier it is.

543
00:20:55,309 --> 00:20:56,675
The more complex,
the more challenging

544
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,176
and exciting, really.

545
00:20:58,212 --> 00:21:00,612
But no, the actual sins,
the sins are on you people.

546
00:21:00,647 --> 00:21:02,114
"You people"?

547
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,149
I got it.

548
00:21:04,184 --> 00:21:05,784
I got it! The name?

549
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:07,018
The whole Lucifer thing?

550
00:21:07,054 --> 00:21:08,987
And desire's, like,
your superpower.

551
00:21:09,022 --> 00:21:11,423
Mm, it's more like
a gift from God really.

552
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,658
Okay, look.

553
00:21:13,694 --> 00:21:16,094
Tell me, Detective,

554
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:19,264
what do you desire more than
anything else in this life?

555
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:22,134
This is it?
This is your big trick?

556
00:21:28,108 --> 00:21:29,708
(sighs)

557
00:21:29,743 --> 00:21:32,010
I guess,
when I was a little girl,

558
00:21:32,045 --> 00:21:35,781
I... always wanted to be a cop
like my daddy,

559
00:21:35,816 --> 00:21:40,018
so that... that one day
I could help people and...

560
00:21:40,053 --> 00:21:42,491
and be taken seriously...

561
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:46,091
...when I say to shut up
and get in the damn car.

562
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:52,497
You're not, like, a Jedi
or something, are you?

563
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:54,599
Get in the car.

564
00:21:54,635 --> 00:21:55,934
No, no, no, no, no.
Look.

565
00:21:55,969 --> 00:21:57,102
I know something you don't know.

566
00:21:57,137 --> 00:21:58,870
Really? What's that?

567
00:21:58,906 --> 00:22:00,472
Won't say unless you
take me with you on this.

568
00:22:00,507 --> 00:22:03,975
Please, come on.
I got to 2Vile, didn't I?

569
00:22:04,011 --> 00:22:05,710
Why do you care
about this so much?

570
00:22:05,746 --> 00:22:06,945
About Delilah?

571
00:22:08,849 --> 00:22:12,117
Look, I just... I just do.

572
00:22:12,152 --> 00:22:13,785
Look, if I hadn't meddled
with her career,

573
00:22:13,821 --> 00:22:16,121
maybe she wouldn't
have died.

574
00:22:16,156 --> 00:22:17,122
Okay.

575
00:22:17,157 --> 00:22:18,657
Okay, fine...
but if this

576
00:22:18,692 --> 00:22:20,625
little clue thing of yours
doesn't pan out,

577
00:22:20,661 --> 00:22:23,028
these are going back on,
and they're gonna stay on.

578
00:22:23,063 --> 00:22:24,765
Is that a promise?

579
00:22:33,548 --> 00:22:35,045
CHLOE: <i>Yeah, therapist
in Beverly Hills</i>

580
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,213
<i>with the first name Linda.</i>

581
00:22:36,248 --> 00:22:37,681
See if Delilah
was a client.

582
00:22:37,716 --> 00:22:38,982
Ah-ah, actually,
she had a pseudonym,

583
00:22:39,017 --> 00:22:40,217
which I also
happen to know.

584
00:22:40,252 --> 00:22:41,651
I'm quite good
at this, aren't I?

585
00:22:41,687 --> 00:22:44,421
- Uh, Penny Lane.
- Okay.

586
00:22:44,456 --> 00:22:46,656
Delilah may have gone
by Penny Lane. Thanks.

587
00:22:49,765 --> 00:22:51,161
Don't look so smug.

588
00:22:51,196 --> 00:22:52,195
Nothing's
panned out yet.

589
00:22:52,231 --> 00:22:53,430
No, no, no, it's not that.

590
00:22:53,465 --> 00:22:55,131
It's just that I knew
that I recognized you.

591
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:56,800
Right.

592
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:58,468
Right, you've seen my boobies.

593
00:22:58,503 --> 00:22:59,436
It's exciting.

594
00:22:59,471 --> 00:23:00,503
What, are you 12?

595
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:01,638
So is the, uh... is the movie

596
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:03,440
why you've got such
a chip on your shoulder?

597
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:05,909
Uh, it's low on the list

598
00:23:05,944 --> 00:23:07,844
- of things I have to live down, I guess.
- Right.

599
00:23:07,879 --> 00:23:10,146
Attractive female cop
struggling to be taken seriously

600
00:23:10,182 --> 00:23:11,815
in a man's man's world...
that it?

601
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:14,484
Yeah, something like that.

602
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:15,819
Well, they're
threatened.

603
00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:18,755
You're clearly smart
and have notable instincts.

604
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,819
Ignore them. Trust yourself.

605
00:23:21,526 --> 00:23:22,826
(cell phone rings)

606
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:25,495
Detective Decker.

607
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,796
All right,
text it to me.

608
00:23:26,832 --> 00:23:28,331
Thanks.

609
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:29,899
What's that?

610
00:23:29,935 --> 00:23:30,965
(sighs)

611
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,869
What you were
saying stands up.

612
00:23:32,904 --> 00:23:34,170
There's a Penny
Lane who sees

613
00:23:34,206 --> 00:23:35,905
a Dr. Linda Martin
in Beverly Hills.

614
00:23:35,941 --> 00:23:38,141
Excellent.
I'll clear my schedule.

615
00:23:38,176 --> 00:23:39,337
(cell phone rings)

616
00:23:39,372 --> 00:23:40,477
Ooh, someone's popular.

617
00:23:40,512 --> 00:23:41,511
Please stop talking.

618
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:43,313
Hello.

619
00:23:43,348 --> 00:23:45,412
What? You're kidding me.
Is she okay?

620
00:23:46,518 --> 00:23:48,385
Oh, of course he's not there.

621
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,719
Thanks.

622
00:23:49,755 --> 00:23:51,755
We got to make
a pit stop.

623
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,856
What?
No, absolutely not.

624
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:55,325
My kid got into a fight.
I got to pick her up.

625
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,027
What, can't she get
herself home?

626
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:58,361
She's seven.

627
00:23:58,397 --> 00:23:59,863
Look, I'm not here
to help you run errands.

628
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:01,364
I'm here to help you
solve a homicide.

629
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,166
Really?

630
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:08,204
("Sinister Kid"
by the Black Keys playing)

631
00:24:14,346 --> 00:24:15,512
CHLOE:
<i>All right.</i>

632
00:24:15,547 --> 00:24:17,080
Wait here.

633
00:24:17,115 --> 00:24:18,381
With pleasure.

634
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:19,949
Despise children.

635
00:24:19,985 --> 00:24:21,453
 Yeah 

636
00:24:21,488 --> 00:24:25,074
 A sinister kid is a kid who 

637
00:24:25,109 --> 00:24:28,310
 Runs to meet his Maker 

638
00:24:28,345 --> 00:24:31,762
 A drop-dead sprint
from the day he's born 

639
00:24:31,797 --> 00:24:34,798
 Straight into
his Maker's arms 

640
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:38,636
 And that's me, that's me 

641
00:24:38,671 --> 00:24:41,943
 The boy with a broken halo. 

642
00:24:55,087 --> 00:24:57,663
I don't think you're allowed
to smoke in here.

643
00:24:58,924 --> 00:25:01,324
Oh, dear, what will
become of me?

644
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,393
My mother is
a police officer.

645
00:25:03,428 --> 00:25:05,128
She could arrest you.

646
00:25:05,163 --> 00:25:06,156
(lighter snaps shut)

647
00:25:06,191 --> 00:25:09,328
Oh, I think I might
know your mother.

648
00:25:09,363 --> 00:25:10,433
What's your name?

649
00:25:10,469 --> 00:25:12,135
Lucifer.

650
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,937
(whispering):
Like the Devil?

651
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:15,705
Exactly.

652
00:25:15,741 --> 00:25:19,642
My name's Beatrice, but
everybody calls me Trixie.

653
00:25:19,678 --> 00:25:21,644
That's a hooker's name.

654
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,979
What's a hooker?

655
00:25:23,014 --> 00:25:24,948
Ask your mother.

656
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:27,951
So... why are you
in trouble?

657
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:30,120
See that girl
over there?

658
00:25:30,894 --> 00:25:32,722
She was bullying me.

659
00:25:32,758 --> 00:25:34,391
She created a fake
Snapchat account

660
00:25:34,426 --> 00:25:36,025
and used it to
make fun of me.

661
00:25:36,061 --> 00:25:40,663
So... I kicked her in the
no-no-touch-touch square.

662
00:25:42,134 --> 00:25:44,134
Oh. Oh, I see.

663
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:47,036
Well played.

664
00:25:47,072 --> 00:25:48,505
Well played, indeed.

665
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,449
Hello, mean girl.

666
00:25:54,579 --> 00:25:56,946
Did you know there's a
special section of Hell

667
00:25:56,982 --> 00:25:58,081
reserved for bullies?

668
00:25:58,116 --> 00:26:00,450
So have fun.

669
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:03,492
(screams)

670
00:26:06,825 --> 00:26:07,991
What did you do?

671
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:09,959
Oh...

672
00:26:09,995 --> 00:26:12,896
I just think someone's feeling
a little guilty.

673
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,691
(school bell rings)

674
00:26:21,239 --> 00:26:22,672
Hi, Daddy.

675
00:26:22,707 --> 00:26:24,007
Hi, munchkin.

676
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:25,175
CHLOE: Wow, shocker,
you're late.

677
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,342
Come on, give
me a break.

678
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:27,644
I'm putting
a case to bed.

679
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,145
Right, like I'm not
working a case, too.

680
00:26:29,181 --> 00:26:31,781
Oh, yeah, the one
you tried to steal from me.

681
00:26:31,817 --> 00:26:33,216
You mean the open and shut one.

682
00:26:33,251 --> 00:26:36,252
You did open and shut it, right?

683
00:26:36,288 --> 00:26:38,121
I'm being diligent, Dan.
It's a high-profile case.

684
00:26:38,156 --> 00:26:39,956
Exactly, which is why you
need to be smart about it.

685
00:26:39,991 --> 00:26:41,891
She is smart.
You're the dimwit.

686
00:26:41,927 --> 00:26:44,961
Perhaps you should refrain from
arguing in front of the child.

687
00:26:44,996 --> 00:26:46,129
It's unbecoming.

688
00:26:47,432 --> 00:26:49,499
I don't know whether to laugh
or to shoot you.

689
00:26:49,534 --> 00:26:51,434
Surprise me.

690
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:53,058
Isn't he funny, Daddy?

691
00:26:53,677 --> 00:26:55,538
CHLOE: Hey, can you, uh,
drop Trix at my mom's?

692
00:26:55,574 --> 00:26:57,040
We got to go. Thank you.

693
00:26:57,075 --> 00:26:59,142
Trixella, give
Mommy a kiss.

694
00:26:59,177 --> 00:27:01,044
I love you so much.

695
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:02,779
Good job standing up
to the mean girl.

696
00:27:02,814 --> 00:27:04,147
Thanks, Mommy.

697
00:27:04,182 --> 00:27:06,082
What's a hooker?

698
00:27:09,287 --> 00:27:11,354
Daddy will tell you.

699
00:27:15,494 --> 00:27:16,759
Bye, Lucifer.

700
00:27:16,795 --> 00:27:18,261
It was nice meeting you.

701
00:27:19,397 --> 00:27:20,897
CHLOE:
Hmm.

702
00:27:20,932 --> 00:27:22,232
Think she likes you.

703
00:27:22,267 --> 00:27:24,909
Of course she does...
what's not to like?

704
00:27:36,661 --> 00:27:39,128
Was your offspring
planned or a mistake?

705
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:42,131
Planned, sort of.

706
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:43,566
Really?

707
00:27:43,601 --> 00:27:45,234
'Cause I've never understood
the human desire to procreate.

708
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:47,036
That's probably
a good thing.

709
00:27:47,071 --> 00:27:48,771
I mean, children are
hideous little creatures,

710
00:27:48,806 --> 00:27:50,139
terrible, taxing burdens.

711
00:27:50,174 --> 00:27:52,241
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

712
00:27:52,277 --> 00:27:53,976
Oh, um, yours is fine.

713
00:27:54,012 --> 00:27:56,379
I mean, you know,
nothing to crow about,

714
00:27:56,414 --> 00:27:57,913
but nothing to be too
embarrassed about, either,

715
00:27:57,949 --> 00:27:59,048
so that's quite good, isn't it?

716
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:02,018
Are you at all aware
of how dickish you sound?

717
00:28:02,053 --> 00:28:03,185
No.

718
00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:07,356
Speaking of dicks...

719
00:28:07,392 --> 00:28:08,824
why was that ex-husband of yours

720
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,845
pressuring you
to close the case?

721
00:28:11,817 --> 00:28:13,417
No reason.

722
00:28:14,999 --> 00:28:16,266
Strange.

723
00:28:16,301 --> 00:28:18,445
Yes, you are.

724
00:28:19,292 --> 00:28:21,104
Did my father send you?

725
00:28:21,139 --> 00:28:22,538
(door opens)

726
00:28:22,573 --> 00:28:25,274
Okay, Detectives,
I'll see you now.

727
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,709
CHLOE:
Thank you.

728
00:28:26,744 --> 00:28:28,244
Oh. "Detectives."

729
00:28:29,614 --> 00:28:31,247
CHLOE: Dr. Martin,
I'd like to ask you

730
00:28:31,282 --> 00:28:33,082
a few questions
about Delilah.

731
00:28:37,689 --> 00:28:40,189
You're thinking
about it, aren't you?

732
00:28:40,224 --> 00:28:41,357
What?

733
00:28:41,392 --> 00:28:42,558
Yes, I wouldn't
recommend it.

734
00:28:42,593 --> 00:28:43,859
I'm like walking heroin.

735
00:28:43,895 --> 00:28:45,861
Very habit-forming.
It never ends well.

736
00:28:45,897 --> 00:28:46,962
(sighs)

737
00:28:46,998 --> 00:28:49,598
I'm sorry, do... do you two
know each other?

738
00:28:49,634 --> 00:28:51,267
No, no, but I know that look.

739
00:28:51,302 --> 00:28:54,203
I don't know
what you're talking about.

740
00:28:55,139 --> 00:28:56,472
That is interesting

741
00:28:56,507 --> 00:28:59,208
'cause... you don't
look at me that way.

742
00:28:59,243 --> 00:29:01,243
- What way?
- With carnal fascination.

743
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,645
That's 'cause
it doesn't exist.

744
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,847
No, you see, that's just it...
with most women, it does.

745
00:29:04,882 --> 00:29:06,649
I tend to appeal to the
dark, mischievous hearts

746
00:29:06,684 --> 00:29:09,885
in all of you, but
you, Detective,

747
00:29:09,921 --> 00:29:12,054
you seem oddly
immune to my charms.

748
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:15,091
Referring to them as "charms,"
I think, is a bit of a stretch.

749
00:29:15,126 --> 00:29:16,726
Truth be told,
I find you repulsive.

750
00:29:16,761 --> 00:29:18,427
Like, on a
chemical level.

751
00:29:18,463 --> 00:29:19,628
That's fascinating.

752
00:29:20,912 --> 00:29:22,398
LUCIFER:
Now, tell me, Linda...

753
00:29:22,433 --> 00:29:23,999
You say it's fascinating,

754
00:29:24,035 --> 00:29:27,069
and yet I can see that it
disturbs you, doesn't it?

755
00:29:27,105 --> 00:29:29,538
Deeply.

756
00:29:29,574 --> 00:29:31,140
CHLOE:
Dr. Martin,

757
00:29:31,175 --> 00:29:33,476
we know that, um, Delilah was
having a clandestine affair

758
00:29:33,511 --> 00:29:35,311
with a wealthy married man,
so if you just

759
00:29:35,346 --> 00:29:37,413
tell us his name,
we will be on our way.

760
00:29:37,448 --> 00:29:39,315
I'm sorry, I can't do that.

761
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:41,083
Oh, she's one of
the complex ones.

762
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:42,318
Linda,

763
00:29:42,353 --> 00:29:44,920
darling, why don't
you tell me? Hmm?

764
00:29:44,956 --> 00:29:46,078
Well, I can't.

765
00:29:46,113 --> 00:29:47,123
(Lucifer chuckles)

766
00:29:47,158 --> 00:29:49,558
I want to, but I can't.

767
00:29:49,594 --> 00:29:50,659
(laughs)

768
00:29:50,695 --> 00:29:52,995
(laughing):
Oh, you're the devil.

769
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,297
(chuckles)
Correct.

770
00:29:55,333 --> 00:29:56,966
Now, come on, Dr. Martin.

771
00:29:57,001 --> 00:29:58,334
I know you want to.

772
00:29:58,369 --> 00:30:01,604
Oh, man, and it's really,
really juicy, too.

773
00:30:01,639 --> 00:30:02,772
Ooh, I bet it is.

774
00:30:02,807 --> 00:30:04,073
No, I can't.

775
00:30:04,108 --> 00:30:05,408
What did you do to her?

776
00:30:05,443 --> 00:30:06,375
Did you roofie her?

777
00:30:06,411 --> 00:30:07,410
Oh, no, it's
not her fault.

778
00:30:07,445 --> 00:30:08,778
She's just
reacting to me.

779
00:30:08,813 --> 00:30:11,147
Just watch
and learn, okay?

780
00:30:11,182 --> 00:30:12,415
Right, the answer is yes,

781
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,784
we can take a trip
to pound town if we must,

782
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:18,754
but first, you're gonna have
to tell us, Linda, okay?

783
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,456
(moaning):
Um...

784
00:30:20,491 --> 00:30:23,025
(chuckles)

785
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:27,623
Okay... (chuckles)
it's Grey Cooper.

786
00:30:27,658 --> 00:30:28,765
Grey Cooper?

787
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,732
Seriously?

788
00:30:29,767 --> 00:30:31,200
That is juicy.

789
00:30:31,235 --> 00:30:32,468
Grey Cooper, the actor?

790
00:30:32,503 --> 00:30:34,069
The one who's married
to Amanda what's-her-chops?

791
00:30:34,105 --> 00:30:35,404
Yeah, yeah.

792
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,206
Oh, no,
he's horrible.

793
00:30:37,241 --> 00:30:40,761
So square-jawed,
so handsome, so vanilla.

794
00:30:40,796 --> 00:30:42,478
Oh, I'm really quite
disappointed in Delilah.

795
00:30:42,513 --> 00:30:46,015
That's truly terrible taste
in the opposite sex.

796
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:47,450
Thank you very
much, Dr. Martin.

797
00:30:47,485 --> 00:30:48,451
We'll be in touch.

798
00:30:48,486 --> 00:30:49,752
All right,
we got to go.

799
00:30:49,787 --> 00:30:51,353
Yes, of course,
but I... I made a deal,

800
00:30:51,389 --> 00:30:53,289
so I'm gonna have to hold up
my end of the bargain.

801
00:30:53,324 --> 00:30:55,391
You wouldn't mind
waiting outside?

802
00:30:55,426 --> 00:30:56,992
Are you seriously talking

803
00:30:57,028 --> 00:30:58,694
about having sex
with her right now?

804
00:30:58,729 --> 00:31:00,896
- Well, it won't take long.
- I do yoga.

805
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:05,634
Hot... yoga.

806
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:08,304
I'm freakishly flexible.

807
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:09,772
Want to see?

808
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,876
Wow!

809
00:31:15,646 --> 00:31:17,580
(chuckles)

810
00:31:17,615 --> 00:31:20,316
I really tried
to keep that one in.

811
00:31:20,351 --> 00:31:23,018
Well, you tried...
that's what matters.

812
00:31:23,054 --> 00:31:24,453
Uh, look,
I'm really sorry,

813
00:31:24,489 --> 00:31:26,455
but I'm gonna have
to take a rain check.

814
00:31:26,491 --> 00:31:27,590
I will be back, okay?

815
00:31:27,625 --> 00:31:28,824
I certainly hope so.

816
00:31:29,727 --> 00:31:31,994
My word is my bond.

817
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:37,603
 It's always something 

818
00:31:37,638 --> 00:31:39,401
 Before the late night 

819
00:31:39,527 --> 00:31:41,170
 Around the corner... 

820
00:31:41,205 --> 00:31:43,506
LUCIFER:
Excuse me! Excuse me.

821
00:31:43,541 --> 00:31:45,908
Ah, excuse me. Thank you.

822
00:31:45,943 --> 00:31:48,210
Hey, hey, sir.

823
00:31:48,246 --> 00:31:50,479
(tires squealing, gunfire)

824
00:31:54,685 --> 00:31:57,219
Who the (bell rings)
is this guy?

825
00:31:57,255 --> 00:31:59,622
What the hell are you doing?

826
00:31:59,657 --> 00:32:00,856
CHLOE: Excuse me.
Excuse me.

827
00:32:00,892 --> 00:32:02,258
Sorry. Excuse me.

828
00:32:02,293 --> 00:32:04,527
Sorry, he's with me.

829
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,830
That's not Grey Cooper.

830
00:32:07,865 --> 00:32:09,164
No, of course not.

831
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,399
What the hell is this?

832
00:32:10,434 --> 00:32:12,434
We need to speak
with Mr. Cooper.

833
00:32:14,977 --> 00:32:18,073
God, Delilah, yeah,
heard about that this morning.

834
00:32:18,109 --> 00:32:19,141
I can't believe it.

835
00:32:19,176 --> 00:32:21,510
We did a movie
together last year.

836
00:32:21,546 --> 00:32:22,545
Got pretty close.

837
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,680
- Lovers?
- Friends.

838
00:32:24,715 --> 00:32:26,248
Friends who were lovers?

839
00:32:26,284 --> 00:32:27,383
CHLOE:
Settle down.

840
00:32:27,418 --> 00:32:28,684
I'll handle
the questions.

841
00:32:28,719 --> 00:32:30,619
Mr. Cooper, when did you last
have contact with Delilah?

842
00:32:30,655 --> 00:32:32,154
Well, actually, I just
have one more question

843
00:32:32,189 --> 00:32:33,756
before you proceed
with the boring ones.

844
00:32:33,791 --> 00:32:36,358
Tell me, Mr. Cooper,

845
00:32:36,394 --> 00:32:38,627
what do you want more
than anything in this world?

846
00:32:38,663 --> 00:32:40,663
What's your deepest,
darkest desire?

847
00:32:40,698 --> 00:32:43,933
You close your eyes,
what do you see?

848
00:32:43,968 --> 00:32:48,470
I'm the president of the
United States of America.

849
00:32:48,506 --> 00:32:49,705
Ha!

850
00:32:50,863 --> 00:32:52,808
Well, who's the Devil now, eh?

851
00:32:52,843 --> 00:32:54,777
Those are some pretty big
aspirations there,

852
00:32:54,812 --> 00:32:57,279
- Mr. Cooper.
- (chuckles) Well, after the acting

853
00:32:57,315 --> 00:32:59,148
- and stuff.
- No need

854
00:32:59,183 --> 00:33:01,550
to be embarrassed. Hell,
if Arnold can do it, right?

855
00:33:01,586 --> 00:33:02,572
- (chuckles)
- Now, you wouldn't

856
00:33:02,607 --> 00:33:03,486
want any nasty secrets

857
00:33:03,521 --> 00:33:05,054
screwing that up for you,
though, would you?

858
00:33:05,089 --> 00:33:06,622
Is there a point to this?

859
00:33:06,657 --> 00:33:09,024
Mr. Cooper, were you having
an affair with Delilah?

860
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,059
AMANDA:
Honey!

861
00:33:10,094 --> 00:33:11,560
Have you been
getting my texts?

862
00:33:11,596 --> 00:33:12,962
I thought they were
breaking you for lunch

863
00:33:12,997 --> 00:33:14,563
like a half hour ago.

864
00:33:15,466 --> 00:33:16,465
What's going on?

865
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,968
These people are detectives.

866
00:33:19,003 --> 00:33:19,969
Real ones?

867
00:33:20,004 --> 00:33:22,071
We have some questions
about Delilah.

868
00:33:22,106 --> 00:33:24,173
Oh. Oh. Yes, it's so sad.

869
00:33:24,208 --> 00:33:26,343
Yeah. Very sad.

870
00:33:26,644 --> 00:33:28,547
Your watch,
where'd you get that?

871
00:33:28,846 --> 00:33:30,312
Oh, it's a prop.

872
00:33:30,348 --> 00:33:31,347
AMANDA:
No, that's the one

873
00:33:31,382 --> 00:33:32,314
Delilah gave you, isn't it?

874
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,682
For<i> Time Will Tell?</i>

875
00:33:33,718 --> 00:33:36,118
GREY: Right.
That's the movie

876
00:33:36,153 --> 00:33:38,387
that we did.
It was a wrap gift.

877
00:33:38,422 --> 00:33:40,723
(chuckles)
Yeah. She buy a $10,000 watch

878
00:33:40,758 --> 00:33:42,291
- for the whole crew?
- Uh, no.

879
00:33:42,326 --> 00:33:44,493
Just me, as far as I know.

880
00:33:44,528 --> 00:33:46,829
'Cause we were,
you know,

881
00:33:46,864 --> 00:33:48,430
costars and everything.

882
00:33:48,466 --> 00:33:50,766
You know, you're gonna have
to get much better at lying

883
00:33:50,801 --> 00:33:52,134
if you want to be president.

884
00:33:52,169 --> 00:33:54,370
I know, right?

885
00:33:54,405 --> 00:33:56,952
So you were sleeping
with her, then, yeah?

886
00:33:57,545 --> 00:34:00,494
- Oh, yeah. (chuckles)
- (laughing)

887
00:34:05,316 --> 00:34:07,116
Crap. I just said that
in front of people.

888
00:34:07,151 --> 00:34:08,717
Whatever.
It's not like I didn't know.

889
00:34:08,753 --> 00:34:10,486
God, you are a
terrible liar.

890
00:34:10,521 --> 00:34:11,754
And actor, by the way.

891
00:34:11,789 --> 00:34:13,122
- You knew?
- Of course.

892
00:34:13,157 --> 00:34:16,659
Why else do you think I've been
sleeping with Bobby?

893
00:34:16,694 --> 00:34:17,826
Are you serious?

894
00:34:17,862 --> 00:34:19,762
Oh, yeah. And it is good.

895
00:34:19,797 --> 00:34:22,331
Mmm. I climb that man
like a tree.

896
00:34:22,366 --> 00:34:23,298
Right, Bobby?

897
00:34:23,334 --> 00:34:25,034
GREY:
My bodyguard?

898
00:34:25,069 --> 00:34:26,902
What a cliché.

899
00:34:26,937 --> 00:34:29,004
Oh, I'm a cliché?
Well, you're a dick.

900
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,172
Oh, boy.

901
00:34:31,542 --> 00:34:33,242
- Hey, guys...
- Come on!

902
00:34:33,277 --> 00:34:35,778
Hey, guys. Arrest them.

903
00:34:35,813 --> 00:34:38,047
- Seriously?
- (grunting)

904
00:34:38,082 --> 00:34:40,983
One of them's got
to be guilty.

905
00:34:46,279 --> 00:34:48,346
 

906
00:34:50,223 --> 00:34:53,972
 Hit me point-blank,
hit me point-blank 

907
00:34:54,007 --> 00:34:55,551
 Hit me point-blank... 

908
00:34:55,587 --> 00:34:58,154
Thanks.
(sighs)

909
00:34:58,189 --> 00:35:02,492
So, Grey and Amanda have
zero connection to the shooter.

910
00:35:02,527 --> 00:35:05,395
(sighs) But the shooter had
the same watch as Grey.

911
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,063
That can't be a coincidence.

912
00:35:07,098 --> 00:35:11,768
Maybe Delilah gave him one, too,
like kind of a go-to gift. I...

913
00:35:11,803 --> 00:35:13,236
Well, that would imply
she was actually

914
00:35:13,271 --> 00:35:14,337
sleeping with that maggot.

915
00:35:14,372 --> 00:35:16,139
Really?

916
00:35:16,174 --> 00:35:19,142
Jimmy, 2Vile,
Grey Cooper.

917
00:35:19,177 --> 00:35:20,610
That's three other maggots
she's sleeping with.

918
00:35:20,645 --> 00:35:22,745
I don't think there's a lot
of discretion going on with her.

919
00:35:22,781 --> 00:35:24,180
Yeah. I suppose you got a point.

920
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:26,482
(chuckles softly)

921
00:35:26,518 --> 00:35:28,618
God, what am I doing here?

922
00:35:28,653 --> 00:35:31,220
Wrong deity, but, yes,
that is the eternal question.

923
00:35:31,256 --> 00:35:34,023
(chuckles)
No. I mean here, in a bar,

924
00:35:34,058 --> 00:35:35,358
- with you.
- Well, I don't know.

925
00:35:35,393 --> 00:35:37,160
You tell me, Detective.

926
00:35:37,195 --> 00:35:39,529
I mean, despite
your proclaimed revulsion,

927
00:35:39,564 --> 00:35:42,131
you can't deny that
there's a connection between us.

928
00:35:42,167 --> 00:35:45,201
Tell me, what do
you actually want?

929
00:35:45,236 --> 00:35:48,204
You mean what do I desire
more than anything else

930
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:49,572
- in this life?
- Yes.

931
00:35:49,607 --> 00:35:50,796
- Mm-hmm.
- No tricks. Not that they work

932
00:35:50,831 --> 00:35:52,041
on you, you freak.

933
00:35:52,076 --> 00:35:53,376
(chuckles)

934
00:35:54,312 --> 00:35:56,913
Seriously. I'm curious.

935
00:35:56,948 --> 00:35:58,448
I don't know.

936
00:35:58,483 --> 00:36:00,149
What-what I told you's true.

937
00:36:00,185 --> 00:36:03,286
I-I really do want
to help people.

938
00:36:04,189 --> 00:36:05,822
My father was a cop.

939
00:36:05,857 --> 00:36:07,356
He was a great cop.

940
00:36:07,392 --> 00:36:09,125
My mother was an actress.

941
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,626
Really cheesy one.
(chuckles)

942
00:36:10,662 --> 00:36:13,830
I tried the acting thing.
I took off my top.

943
00:36:13,865 --> 00:36:16,365
Wasn't really contributing
to the betterment of society.

944
00:36:16,401 --> 00:36:18,501
I disagree. I love that movie.

945
00:36:18,536 --> 00:36:19,769
(chuckles)

946
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:20,837
So I quit.

947
00:36:20,872 --> 00:36:22,538
Decided to become a cop
like my dad

948
00:36:22,574 --> 00:36:25,208
and, uh, dealt with the whole
<i>Hot Tub High School</i> thing,

949
00:36:25,243 --> 00:36:26,876
until, um,

950
00:36:26,911 --> 00:36:29,078
I became a detective
and found a whole new way

951
00:36:29,113 --> 00:36:31,447
- to ostracize myself.
- Ah, the...

952
00:36:31,483 --> 00:36:33,950
reason your ex-maggot
was pressuring you

953
00:36:33,985 --> 00:36:35,585
to close this?

954
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,153
Yeah. Yeah.

955
00:36:37,188 --> 00:36:39,355
Exactly. There was a case,

956
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:42,191
a shooting on Palmetto Street
where a cop was shot,

957
00:36:42,227 --> 00:36:44,460
and I saw it differently
than pretty much everyone

958
00:36:44,496 --> 00:36:46,596
in my department,
including my ex.

959
00:36:46,631 --> 00:36:48,297
And I stuck
my neck out,

960
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:50,399
and it backfired.

961
00:36:50,435 --> 00:36:52,468
And, uh, now...

962
00:36:52,504 --> 00:36:55,204
(chuckles)
no one wants to work with me.

963
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,206
Well, I'm available.

964
00:36:58,681 --> 00:37:00,409
Too bad your little protégé

965
00:37:00,445 --> 00:37:01,744
isn't around
to collect the check.

966
00:37:01,779 --> 00:37:03,045
REPORTER:
The soundtrack album

967
00:37:03,081 --> 00:37:04,347
for the movie<i> Time Will Tell</i>

968
00:37:04,382 --> 00:37:07,083
has reached number 15
on the Billboard charts

969
00:37:07,118 --> 00:37:08,851
and is still climbing.
Song and record sales...

970
00:37:08,887 --> 00:37:10,219
Oh, wow.

971
00:37:11,222 --> 00:37:12,688
What?

972
00:37:14,025 --> 00:37:16,726
Delilah didn't give that watch
to the drug dealer.

973
00:37:21,649 --> 00:37:24,133
 Got a heavy load,
sometimes I wonder... 

974
00:37:24,169 --> 00:37:25,160
- Stop, stop, stop!
- (music stops)

975
00:37:25,195 --> 00:37:28,052
What is it? You got a gerbil in
your throat? What's going on?

976
00:37:29,941 --> 00:37:31,107
Hello, Jimmy.

977
00:37:31,142 --> 00:37:32,842
Really?

978
00:37:32,877 --> 00:37:34,477
How's the album sales doing?

979
00:37:34,512 --> 00:37:35,811
What album?

980
00:37:35,847 --> 00:37:38,114
Soundtrack to<i> Time Will Tell,</i>
which you produced.

981
00:37:38,149 --> 00:37:41,584
Whitney Houston hit the top ten
for album sales after her death.

982
00:37:41,619 --> 00:37:43,553
Michael Jackson hit
the stratosphere.

983
00:37:43,588 --> 00:37:46,556
Not sure you'll achieve such
heights having Delilah killed,

984
00:37:46,591 --> 00:37:49,792
but that sure is a boatload of
royalty checks headed your way.

985
00:37:49,827 --> 00:37:53,296
Guess you really
needed the cash, huh?

986
00:37:53,331 --> 00:37:56,566
Which is why you had to pay
the shooter with your watch.

987
00:37:56,601 --> 00:37:58,868
The watch Delilah gave you.
Now, that's just sick.

988
00:37:58,903 --> 00:38:00,636
But then you are, so...

989
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,562
(gun clicks)

990
00:38:03,597 --> 00:38:04,807
Hey, Jimmy?

991
00:38:04,842 --> 00:38:06,309
I made her,
and she ruined me.

992
00:38:06,344 --> 00:38:09,278
She humiliated me.
She owes me.

993
00:38:09,314 --> 00:38:11,809
You're not God, Jimmy.
You didn't make her.

994
00:38:12,076 --> 00:38:13,482
But you did destroy her.

995
00:38:13,518 --> 00:38:15,384
So I'm gonna punish you.

996
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,054
You back off,
you freak. I mean it.

997
00:38:18,089 --> 00:38:20,323
I am not going to jail
for that bitch. No chance.

998
00:38:20,358 --> 00:38:21,691
Listen to him,
Lucifer. Back off.

999
00:38:21,726 --> 00:38:23,759
I told you, it's fine.
I'm immortal.

1000
00:38:26,364 --> 00:38:28,664
Why did you do that?

1001
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,733
- He was gonna kill you.
- No, no, no,

1002
00:38:30,768 --> 00:38:33,669
no, no, no. You just...
you just let him off too easy.

1003
00:38:33,705 --> 00:38:35,738
He needs to pay!
He needs to suffer!

1004
00:38:35,773 --> 00:38:37,373
He needs to feel the pain,

1005
00:38:37,408 --> 00:38:39,842
- not escape it!
- Don't worry.

1006
00:38:39,877 --> 00:38:42,244
I'm sure where he's going,
the pain's coming.

1007
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,080
No. No, it's not, actually.

1008
00:38:44,115 --> 00:38:46,215
And you know why?
Because I'm here and he's...

1009
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,451
- (gunshots)
- (gasps)

1010
00:38:53,391 --> 00:38:54,890
(gasping)

1011
00:38:54,926 --> 00:38:57,593
Chloe.

1012
00:38:57,629 --> 00:38:58,861
(gasping)

1013
00:38:58,896 --> 00:39:01,631
(weakly):
I don't want to die.

1014
00:39:01,666 --> 00:39:04,367
I won't let you.

1015
00:39:05,803 --> 00:39:08,510
Your father will just have
to wait for you.

1016
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,741
- (gunshots)
- (groaning)

1017
00:39:13,285 --> 00:39:16,345
Just... give me one second.

1018
00:39:16,381 --> 00:39:19,215
(gunshots)

1019
00:39:22,286 --> 00:39:23,386
(grunts)

1020
00:39:23,421 --> 00:39:24,620
JIMMY:
No, please! No, no,

1021
00:39:24,656 --> 00:39:26,756
please! Please.

1022
00:39:26,791 --> 00:39:29,225
Please don't kill me.

1023
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,559
Oh, Jimmy.

1024
00:39:32,563 --> 00:39:34,263
You're gonna wish
that's all

1025
00:39:34,298 --> 00:39:36,999
- I did to you.
- (screaming)

1026
00:39:51,516 --> 00:39:52,882
LUCIFER:
Well,

1027
00:39:52,917 --> 00:39:55,685
look who's back.

1028
00:39:57,989 --> 00:39:59,789
(groans)

1029
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,393
How long have I been out?

1030
00:40:04,429 --> 00:40:07,396
(sighs)
Three years.

1031
00:40:08,299 --> 00:40:09,598
What?

1032
00:40:09,634 --> 00:40:10,866
(chuckling)

1033
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:14,370
You're such an ass.

1034
00:40:14,405 --> 00:40:16,539
- Thank you.
- Oh, God.

1035
00:40:19,847 --> 00:40:21,963
He was firing at you.

1036
00:40:22,373 --> 00:40:24,059
Why aren't you...

1037
00:40:24,182 --> 00:40:26,041
more dead?

1038
00:40:26,076 --> 00:40:28,384
You're having a very hard time
with the immortal thing,

1039
00:40:28,419 --> 00:40:30,519
aren't you?

1040
00:40:30,555 --> 00:40:32,088
(sighs)

1041
00:40:33,391 --> 00:40:35,491
- What happened with Jimmy?
- Jimmy?

1042
00:40:35,526 --> 00:40:37,960
Jimmy got what he deserved.

1043
00:40:37,995 --> 00:40:39,895
Hmm?

1044
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:43,666
Well, I'm pretty sure
I'd be dead

1045
00:40:43,701 --> 00:40:45,201
if you hadn't helped me,
so...

1046
00:40:45,236 --> 00:40:47,336
thank you.

1047
00:40:47,371 --> 00:40:49,271
Sorry, what was that?
That last bit.

1048
00:40:49,307 --> 00:40:51,373
I didn't quite
get that.

1049
00:40:52,243 --> 00:40:54,143
Thank you.

1050
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:57,179
You're welcome.

1051
00:40:57,215 --> 00:40:58,981
And, besides, you know,

1052
00:40:59,016 --> 00:41:02,182
you're far too interesting
to let die.

1053
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,754
You saved my life
because I'm interesting?

1054
00:41:04,789 --> 00:41:06,889
Wildly irritating as well,
but yes.

1055
00:41:06,924 --> 00:41:08,124
(chuckles softly)

1056
00:41:10,428 --> 00:41:11,594
So what now?

1057
00:41:11,629 --> 00:41:13,195
Well, I mean,
I've obviously proven myself

1058
00:41:13,231 --> 00:41:14,597
to be an invaluable
crime-fighting tool.

1059
00:41:14,632 --> 00:41:17,032
You're a pariah
in the department.

1060
00:41:17,068 --> 00:41:18,200
I think this could be the start

1061
00:41:18,236 --> 00:41:19,335
of a beautiful friendship.
Don't you?

1062
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:21,470
Who the hell are you?

1063
00:41:21,506 --> 00:41:23,739
I told you, I'm...

1064
00:41:23,775 --> 00:41:25,441
Lucifer!

1065
00:41:26,277 --> 00:41:28,577
Uh, yes. Hello, child.

1066
00:41:28,613 --> 00:41:30,613
Um, just... Why don't you save

1067
00:41:30,648 --> 00:41:32,448
some of this unpleasantness
for your mother, yeah?

1068
00:41:32,483 --> 00:41:33,716
- (groans)
- Ooh.

1069
00:41:33,751 --> 00:41:35,718
- Sorry.
- Oh.

1070
00:41:35,753 --> 00:41:37,887
- God.
- Are you hurt?

1071
00:41:37,922 --> 00:41:39,121
I'm okay.

1072
00:41:39,157 --> 00:41:40,823
LUCIFER: Right.
Well, I'd stay for

1073
00:41:40,858 --> 00:41:42,958
the family reunion,
but it's giving me terrible IBS.

1074
00:41:42,994 --> 00:41:45,528
So, look forward
to seeing you soon, Chloe.

1075
00:41:45,563 --> 00:41:47,530
- I don't.
- Bye, now.

1076
00:41:47,565 --> 00:41:49,064
Glad you're not dead.

1077
00:41:51,702 --> 00:41:55,576
 Always something
before the late night 

1078
00:41:55,611 --> 00:41:57,706
 Around the corner,
there's always 

1079
00:41:57,741 --> 00:41:59,809
(distorting):
 Something waiting for you... 

1080
00:41:59,844 --> 00:42:02,378
(groans)
Bloody hell.

1081
00:42:07,652 --> 00:42:09,952
What do you want
from me?

1082
00:42:09,987 --> 00:42:12,421
I've been watching you, Lucifer.

1083
00:42:12,456 --> 00:42:14,423
- You perv.
- And I'm not sure

1084
00:42:14,458 --> 00:42:16,058
I like what I see.

1085
00:42:16,093 --> 00:42:18,761
You're showing restraint, mercy.

1086
00:42:18,796 --> 00:42:21,897
You scared I'm turning my back
on the dark side, bro?

1087
00:42:21,933 --> 00:42:25,634
Lucifer, there is a balance here
that we must maintain.

1088
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:28,304
I strongly suggest you do
what I told you to do

1089
00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:29,738
and go back to Hell.

1090
00:42:29,774 --> 00:42:32,741
Don't threaten me, Amenadiel.

1091
00:42:32,777 --> 00:42:35,377
I mean, you don't want
to start a war.

1092
00:42:35,413 --> 00:42:38,647
I would love a war.

1093
00:42:38,683 --> 00:42:40,783
(chuckling)

1094
00:42:40,818 --> 00:42:43,619
Oh, Luci.

1095
00:42:43,654 --> 00:42:47,156
My hatred for you grows stronger
with every visit.

1096
00:42:47,191 --> 00:42:50,459
Well, I wouldn't have it
any other way, pal.

1097
00:42:50,494 --> 00:42:53,596
I look forward
to eating your heart one day.

1098
00:42:53,631 --> 00:42:55,297
Peace.

1099
00:43:00,037 --> 00:43:03,205
(wings flapping)

1100
00:43:03,241 --> 00:43:05,441
Ugh.

1101
00:43:13,718 --> 00:43:15,885
I sense your
disapproval, Maze.

1102
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,853
What is it?

1103
00:43:17,889 --> 00:43:23,292
I just can't understand
why you would save a human life.

1104
00:43:23,327 --> 00:43:25,794
Well, there's...
something different about her

1105
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:28,364
that I don't quite understand,
and it vexes me.

1106
00:43:28,399 --> 00:43:30,933
Maybe it's not her
that's different.

1107
00:43:30,968 --> 00:43:33,569
(chuckles) Is this
where I'm supposed to ask,

1108
00:43:33,604 --> 00:43:35,304
"Whatever do you mean?"

1109
00:43:35,339 --> 00:43:38,007
I'm worried the humans
are rubbing off on you.

1110
00:43:38,042 --> 00:43:40,442
Stop caring.

1111
00:43:41,412 --> 00:43:43,545
You're the Devil.

1112
00:43:45,816 --> 00:43:47,616
Yes, I am.

1113
00:43:47,652 --> 00:43:49,885
 

1114
00:44:01,198 --> 00:44:03,265
- Okay. Right.
- Uh...

1115
00:44:03,301 --> 00:44:05,534
Here's the deal.
We can have as much naked

1116
00:44:05,569 --> 00:44:07,603
cuddle time
as you desire, but...

1117
00:44:07,638 --> 00:44:09,838
you're gonna have
to listen to me, too.

1118
00:44:09,874 --> 00:44:13,142
There's a few things that
I'd like to discuss with you.

1119
00:44:13,177 --> 00:44:16,478
You know, just a...
an existential dilemma or two.

1120
00:44:16,514 --> 00:44:17,680
Deal?

1121
00:44:17,715 --> 00:44:20,215
- Yes.
- Lovely.

1122
00:44:20,795 --> 00:44:23,892
 Oh, no, there ain't
no rest for the wicked 

1123
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:27,673
 Until we close
our eyes for...

- <i>Previously on</i> Lucifer...
- <i>You're the Lord of Hell,</i>

00:00:04,843 --> 00:00:05,834
for crying out loud.

3
00:00:05,869 --> 00:00:08,156
Shouldn't you be spending
your valuable time

4
00:00:08,191 --> 00:00:10,692
doing something more significant?

5
00:00:10,727 --> 00:00:13,232
I'm retired, Maze. I've
got nothing but time.

6
00:00:13,267 --> 00:00:15,924
Your return to the
Underworld has been requested.

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,928
Remind Dad that I quit Hell

8
00:00:17,963 --> 00:00:20,541
because I was sick and tired
of playing a part in his play.

9
00:00:21,232 --> 00:00:22,826
<i>We should be out there
solving a homicide</i>

10
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:24,558
<i>and punishing those responsible.</i>

11
00:00:24,593 --> 00:00:26,299
We? How could you possibly help me?

12
00:00:26,334 --> 00:00:27,407
I have the ability

13
00:00:27,442 --> 00:00:29,772
to draw out peoples' forbidden desires.

14
00:00:29,807 --> 00:00:31,972
I got it. I got it. The name,

15
00:00:32,007 --> 00:00:33,243
the whole Lucifer thing.

16
00:00:33,278 --> 00:00:34,800
And desire is like your superpower.

17
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:36,445
Mm, it's more like a gift from God really.

18
00:00:36,515 --> 00:00:37,933
You're thinking about it, aren't you?

19
00:00:37,968 --> 00:00:39,095
See, I wouldn't recommend it.

20
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,229
I'm like walking heroin.

21
00:00:40,264 --> 00:00:42,051
Ah, you're the Devil.

22
00:00:42,086 --> 00:00:43,349
Mm, correct.

23
00:00:50,214 --> 00:00:51,809
Give me one second.

24
00:00:53,798 --> 00:00:55,957
Please. Please don't kill me.

25
00:00:55,992 --> 00:00:58,300
You're gonna wish that's all I did to you.

26
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,075
<i>I just can't understand</i>

27
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,205
<i>why you would save a human life.</i>

28
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,306
Something different about her

29
00:01:03,341 --> 00:01:05,555
that I don't quite
understand, and it vexes me.

30
00:01:05,635 --> 00:01:07,384
Maybe it's not her that's different.

31
00:01:07,419 --> 00:01:08,641
<i>Right. Here's the deal.</i>

32
00:01:08,676 --> 00:01:11,155
We can have as much naked
cuddle time as you desire,

33
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,245
but you're gonna have to listen to me, too.

34
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,772
You know, just an existential
dilemma or two. Deal?

35
00:01:15,807 --> 00:01:17,419
<i>Yes.</i>

36
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,007
Save your soul! It's up to you!

37
00:01:39,043 --> 00:01:40,576
I ask you to repent!

38
00:01:40,611 --> 00:01:43,679
Repent your sins before it is too late!

39
00:01:43,714 --> 00:01:45,788
It is the end of times!

40
00:01:45,823 --> 00:01:47,393
The Devil walks among us!

41
00:01:47,428 --> 00:01:51,520
Padre, you have no idea how right you are.

42
00:01:51,555 --> 00:01:53,122
But there's no need to be angry about it.

43
00:01:53,157 --> 00:01:54,390
Enjoy the ride.

44
00:01:54,425 --> 00:01:55,791
Bless you.

45
00:01:55,826 --> 00:01:57,626
Have you seen the face of the Devil?

46
00:01:57,661 --> 00:02:00,662
Oh, every morning in the mirror, pal.

47
00:02:00,698 --> 00:02:02,030
Exactly!

48
00:02:02,066 --> 00:02:03,432
He's in all of us!

49
00:02:03,467 --> 00:02:05,567
In our every moment of weakness.

50
00:02:05,603 --> 00:02:07,002
Look at this world!

51
00:02:07,037 --> 00:02:09,605
The sin, the lust!

52
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,773
It is the Devil's touch.

53
00:02:10,808 --> 00:02:12,875
N-N-No, don't give me
credit for all that.

54
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,277
You humans do plenty all on your own.

55
00:02:20,147 --> 00:02:21,817
What's your problem, pal?

56
00:02:22,064 --> 00:02:23,719
Excuse me?

57
00:02:23,754 --> 00:02:25,702
Yeah, uh, why don't you
move your shtick along.

58
00:02:25,737 --> 00:02:26,967
Okay, I'm not sharing my tips with you,

59
00:02:27,002 --> 00:02:29,391
- if that's what you're angling for.
- Oh.

60
00:02:29,427 --> 00:02:31,155
Right. Is this a performance?

61
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,228
Are you like the Chewbacca and
the Spider-Man down the street?

62
00:02:33,264 --> 00:02:34,963
I have to say, you're very good.

63
00:02:34,999 --> 00:02:36,732
Yeah, so why don't you go bother them.

64
00:02:36,805 --> 00:02:38,247
You're bad for my business.

65
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,084
Repent! The Devil...

66
00:02:40,173 --> 00:02:42,909
Isn't finished with you yet.

67
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:46,577
You see, what I hate more
than anything is a liar,

68
00:02:46,612 --> 00:02:50,952
a charlatan, someone who
doesn't believe in what they say.

69
00:02:51,534 --> 00:02:53,248
So what are you gonna do about it?

70
00:02:53,505 --> 00:02:56,784
Why, make you a believer, of course.

71
00:02:59,757 --> 00:03:01,523
S-S... uh, stay away!

72
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:02,858
He's the Devil!

73
00:03:02,893 --> 00:03:03,900
You don't understand!

74
00:03:03,935 --> 00:03:06,534
This isn't a performance! He's the Devil!

75
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:07,963
He's the Devil!

76
00:03:07,998 --> 00:03:09,965
It's true. It is true.

77
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,709
Yes, thanks, everyone.

78
00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:17,711
I'm, uh, here till, well,
the end of time, actually.

79
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:19,741
- <i>So you're the Devil.</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

80
00:03:19,777 --> 00:03:24,386
Yes. Well, Satan, Beelzebub, Old Scratch.

81
00:03:24,482 --> 00:03:26,448
Actually, I like that one in particular.

82
00:03:26,528 --> 00:03:28,094
But, uh, those were the old me.

83
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:30,123
These days, you just
have plain old Lucifer.

84
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:34,545
And you've left Hell behind to
take a vacation in Los Angeles.

85
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,353
Well, where else would I go?

86
00:03:37,795 --> 00:03:39,312
You don't seem too bothered

87
00:03:39,366 --> 00:03:41,790
by my being the Prince of Darkness.

88
00:03:41,923 --> 00:03:44,199
I'm willing to work within your metaphor.

89
00:03:44,668 --> 00:03:45,634
Right.

90
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:47,903
Sometimes it's easier
to make intimate issues

91
00:03:47,938 --> 00:03:50,372
about something bigger than yourself.

92
00:03:50,407 --> 00:03:52,574
Well, there are few
things bigger than myself.

93
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,393
I'm well aware.

94
00:03:56,225 --> 00:03:58,413
Ah.

95
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:02,885
Last we spoke, you were bothered
about feelings of humanity.

96
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,287
I was, yes, but I have good
news for you on that front.

97
00:04:05,322 --> 00:04:06,469
I'm healed.

98
00:04:06,504 --> 00:04:07,422
Is that so?

99
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:10,240
Yes. Yes, back to my normal, devilish self.

100
00:04:10,275 --> 00:04:12,247
No pesky empathy to be found.

101
00:04:12,282 --> 00:04:14,138
I'd kick a puppy if one waltzed by.

102
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:16,569
I'm joking. Puppies don't waltz.

103
00:04:17,014 --> 00:04:19,023
You like to hide insecurity in humor,

104
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:19,918
don't you?

105
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,476
I don't have insecurities.

106
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:24,632
Mm. Everyone does.

107
00:04:25,707 --> 00:04:28,844
Very well. I'll play your game.

108
00:04:29,118 --> 00:04:30,815
What do you think I'm insecure about?

109
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,248
That you <i>are</i> changing,

110
00:04:33,284 --> 00:04:36,143
but that you don't know
what's causing the change.

111
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,045
Or who.

112
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,593
We'll pick this up next time.

113
00:04:41,628 --> 00:04:43,803
What? Oh, very well.

114
00:04:43,838 --> 00:04:46,260
A deal's a deal. Though, why do I feel

115
00:04:46,295 --> 00:04:48,047
like you're getting more
out of our bargain than I am?

116
00:04:48,082 --> 00:04:49,131
Ooh! Hello!

117
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,500
Thank you. Here.

118
00:04:51,535 --> 00:04:53,902
- Donald.
- How are you, sir?

119
00:05:26,888 --> 00:05:29,145
- Oh, I didn't order a drink.
- Courtesy of the owner.

120
00:05:29,254 --> 00:05:30,673
This is from Lucifer?

121
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:33,241
He asked me to make you
something you'd like.

122
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,151
Did I get it wrong?

123
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:37,944
You and Lucifer seem really close.

124
00:05:38,222 --> 00:05:40,616
I followed him through the gates of Hell.

125
00:05:40,651 --> 00:05:42,351
I'll take that as a "yes."

126
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,274
Hello, Detective.

127
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,677
How has your undercover surveillance

128
00:06:08,712 --> 00:06:10,412
of my activities gone so far?

129
00:06:10,447 --> 00:06:12,274
I've looked into you.

130
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:14,552
Your name really is Lucifer Morningstar.

131
00:06:14,587 --> 00:06:17,619
And as far as I can tell, you
didn't exist five years ago.

132
00:06:17,654 --> 00:06:19,154
On the earthly plane, no.

133
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:22,758
People don't appear out of thin air.

134
00:06:22,793 --> 00:06:24,369
Who were you?

135
00:06:24,408 --> 00:06:28,065
How did you survive getting
shot six times by Jimmy Barnes?

136
00:06:28,213 --> 00:06:30,632
Is that your normal reaction
to someone saving your life?

137
00:06:30,668 --> 00:06:32,470
- Investigating them?
- When I see something

138
00:06:32,505 --> 00:06:34,508
I can't explain, yeah, I look for answers.

139
00:06:34,543 --> 00:06:37,506
Well, I've given you the answer, Detective.
It's not my fault you won't accept it.

140
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:38,439
Do you know what I think?

141
00:06:38,474 --> 00:06:40,192
I stopped trying to guess.

142
00:06:40,227 --> 00:06:41,777
I think you like me.

143
00:06:41,812 --> 00:06:44,590
What part of the look on my
face gives you that impression?

144
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:47,226
No, no, no, it's not about
the face. It's about the eyes,

145
00:06:47,261 --> 00:06:48,612
what's behind them. I think you see

146
00:06:48,665 --> 00:06:51,424
something that you truly desire, and you...

147
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:52,728
you don't know what to do with yourself,

148
00:06:52,798 --> 00:06:55,090
do you?

149
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,958
Really?

150
00:06:56,994 --> 00:06:58,260
Uh-huh.

151
00:06:59,654 --> 00:07:02,084
- Hmm.
- That's more like it.

152
00:07:05,581 --> 00:07:08,275
Detective, I never knew you cared.

153
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,138
Mm.

154
00:07:09,457 --> 00:07:11,580
Ooh.

155
00:07:18,767 --> 00:07:20,936
No bulletproof vest.

156
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:22,077
What?

157
00:07:22,113 --> 00:07:23,494
I just couldn't imagine how you'd get it

158
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:25,583
under that suit, but I had to check.

159
00:07:25,618 --> 00:07:27,425
What is it? What is it? What is it?

160
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,148
I'm gonna figure out your secret, Lucifer.

161
00:07:29,183 --> 00:07:31,457
Not a secret if I'm telling you the answer!

162
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,695
It's...

163
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:36,024
Why don't I affect you, Detective?

164
00:07:36,059 --> 00:07:37,799
What makes you different?

165
00:07:37,948 --> 00:07:39,935
I guess we both have our mysteries.

166
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,471
Ah. Well, I'll show you
mine if you show me yours.

167
00:07:43,705 --> 00:07:45,607
Oh, God, not that again.

168
00:07:46,038 --> 00:07:47,278
Decker.

169
00:07:49,313 --> 00:07:50,612
Are you sure?

170
00:07:50,647 --> 00:07:51,747
Yes.

171
00:07:51,782 --> 00:07:54,182
Yes, um, please send me the address.

172
00:07:54,218 --> 00:07:56,079
I... I owe you one.

173
00:07:56,114 --> 00:07:58,770
Oh, finally.

174
00:07:58,874 --> 00:08:01,414
Now <i>that</i> affected you. What was it?

175
00:08:02,753 --> 00:08:04,094
Detective?

176
00:08:04,461 --> 00:08:06,461
Detective?!

177
00:08:11,335 --> 00:08:13,435
Come on. Active scene.

178
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:21,778
The victim was being
followed by a paparazzo.

179
00:08:21,813 --> 00:08:22,811
Tried to lose his tail.

180
00:08:22,846 --> 00:08:24,513
Instead, lost control of his car.

181
00:08:24,548 --> 00:08:26,024
Died on impact.

182
00:08:26,247 --> 00:08:27,885
The paparazzo following him was...?

183
00:08:27,953 --> 00:08:29,918
Was Nick Hofmeister, yeah.

184
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,021
Who's the victim?

185
00:08:33,335 --> 00:08:35,091
Robbie Russell Jr.

186
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:37,192
The son of the movie star?

187
00:08:37,614 --> 00:08:39,624
He wasn't in the business, was he?

188
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:41,828
Didn't stop everyone from
wanting pictures of him.

189
00:08:41,863 --> 00:08:42,983
They're vultures.

190
00:08:43,018 --> 00:08:44,633
You get a statement from Nick?

191
00:08:44,668 --> 00:08:48,103
You can't be involved in an active
case until you're off medical leave.

192
00:08:49,251 --> 00:08:52,073
Listen, I get why you
wanted to be here, I do.

193
00:08:52,854 --> 00:08:54,409
But you have to bring him?

194
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,316
You've got to be kidding me.

195
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,278
What are you doing here?

196
00:09:03,555 --> 00:09:05,383
Oh! How's your ex?

197
00:09:05,442 --> 00:09:07,128
He's not the reason you
rushed over here, is he?

198
00:09:07,194 --> 00:09:08,427
Answer the question.

199
00:09:08,492 --> 00:09:10,354
I'm trying to solve my mystery, Detective.

200
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,641
If I don't affect you, I'm
curious as to what does.

201
00:09:14,565 --> 00:09:17,851
Oh, and I think I've just found my answer.

202
00:09:17,886 --> 00:09:18,917
Who's that?

203
00:09:19,022 --> 00:09:20,202
He's a paparazzo.

204
00:09:20,237 --> 00:09:22,120
Oh. Had a little run-in with him

205
00:09:22,155 --> 00:09:25,092
during your <i>Hot Tub High School</i>
days, did you? Huh? Is that it?

206
00:09:25,127 --> 00:09:26,974
Yeah, you could say that. He's a cockroach.

207
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:29,025
But he'll figure a way out
of this. He always does.

208
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,846
You want to talk to him, don't you?

209
00:09:30,881 --> 00:09:32,681
Well, go on, then. What's stopping you?

210
00:09:32,716 --> 00:09:34,182
The rules? Huh?

211
00:09:34,218 --> 00:09:35,450
Detective Douche?

212
00:09:35,485 --> 00:09:37,602
If you desire something, just take it.

213
00:09:37,641 --> 00:09:39,487
Lucifer, what are you doing?

214
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:41,424
Hello.

215
00:09:43,895 --> 00:09:45,645
You finally did it, Nick.

216
00:09:45,749 --> 00:09:49,113
You finally wanted a photo so
bad that you killed someone.

217
00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:50,265
You're not gonna get away with this.

218
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,944
I'm gonna make sure of it.

219
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,468
You're right.

220
00:09:53,503 --> 00:09:54,479
- Say that again?
- You're right.

221
00:09:54,514 --> 00:09:56,918
I went too far. I'll confess.

222
00:09:57,711 --> 00:09:58,408
Okay.

223
00:09:58,443 --> 00:10:01,503
Maybe he's less cockroach,
more dung beetle?

224
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,208
Police work always this easy?

225
00:10:03,243 --> 00:10:04,316
No. That's the problem.

226
00:10:04,351 --> 00:10:06,775
Right. Well, do you mind
if I give it a whirl?

227
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,184
Tell me, dung beetle,

228
00:10:09,219 --> 00:10:11,753
what is it you desire?

229
00:10:13,281 --> 00:10:17,292
I... would like to confess.

230
00:10:17,327 --> 00:10:19,030
Yes, yes, yes, but why?

231
00:10:19,065 --> 00:10:20,386
Because I deserve it.

232
00:10:20,421 --> 00:10:22,064
I've just done...

233
00:10:23,202 --> 00:10:25,267
...so many terrible things, you know?

234
00:10:25,302 --> 00:10:27,525
I see it as my chance to-to...

235
00:10:27,595 --> 00:10:28,855
Chance to what?

236
00:10:28,926 --> 00:10:30,714
No. I...

237
00:10:31,108 --> 00:10:32,630
I... If I tell you,

238
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,845
- he's just gonna... No. Just...
- He? Who?

239
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,810
Would you please make him stop?

240
00:10:35,887 --> 00:10:37,058
- Who? He who?
- Him.

241
00:10:37,093 --> 00:10:37,869
- Tell him.
- What are you hiding?

242
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:39,721
- What are you doing? Hey.
- You said "he." Who?

243
00:10:39,756 --> 00:10:42,092
Neither one of you are supposed
to be here. Especially you.

244
00:10:42,127 --> 00:10:43,318
Come on.

245
00:10:43,485 --> 00:10:45,692
All right. Temper, temper.

246
00:10:48,992 --> 00:10:50,492
Right. Well, that's done.

247
00:10:50,527 --> 00:10:52,193
No.

248
00:10:52,229 --> 00:10:53,576
If Nick's covering for someone,

249
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,346
that means the real
murderer is still out there.

250
00:10:55,381 --> 00:10:57,465
Yes, plenty of murderers
are out there, Detective.

251
00:10:57,501 --> 00:11:00,030
You heard the man. He
deserves the punishment.

252
00:11:00,065 --> 00:11:01,937
At least he's getting it.

253
00:11:02,114 --> 00:11:03,705
But that's not enough for you, is it?

254
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,140
You hate that dung beetle.

255
00:11:05,175 --> 00:11:07,575
Are you really gonna try
and prove his innocence?

256
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:10,578
I'm gonna find out who
really killed this kid.

257
00:11:10,614 --> 00:11:12,403
So that's a yes.

258
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,915
Wow, aren't you full of surprises.

259
00:11:17,054 --> 00:11:19,587
Well, where do we begin?

260
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:25,604
Sync and corrections by explosiveskull
www.addic7ed.com

261
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,821
You think Nick Hofmeister is innocent? You?

262
00:11:40,857 --> 00:11:42,490
He confessed, Dan.

263
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:44,026
Nick wouldn't confess to a parking ticket,

264
00:11:44,061 --> 00:11:44,925
let alone a murder.

265
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,707
It just sounded like

266
00:11:46,742 --> 00:11:48,296
- he was covering for someone.
- So wait.

267
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:51,777
First he confessed, then
he told you he didn't do it?

268
00:11:51,847 --> 00:11:53,050
Well, he didn't want to.

269
00:11:53,085 --> 00:11:54,518
You know, Lucifer, um...

270
00:11:55,701 --> 00:11:56,636
...made him.

271
00:11:56,671 --> 00:11:58,172
Do I even want to know what that means?

272
00:11:58,207 --> 00:12:00,853
Look, he was about to tell us more
before you came and took him away, Dan.

273
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:02,510
You know what, his car is at the scene.

274
00:12:02,545 --> 00:12:04,201
- He confessed.
- I know.

275
00:12:04,236 --> 00:12:05,846
Is this the fight that you want to pick?

276
00:12:05,882 --> 00:12:07,858
Just promise me you'll look into it.

277
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,450
I'll do my job.

278
00:12:09,631 --> 00:12:11,311
- Go home.
- Okay.

279
00:12:11,346 --> 00:12:13,685
And take your weird
club-owner sidekick with you

280
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,551
- before I arrest him.
- For what?

281
00:12:15,586 --> 00:12:18,252
Let's start with smoking
pot at a crime scene.

282
00:12:19,482 --> 00:12:21,595
Uh, sorry, do you want a hit?

283
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:22,926
N-No.

284
00:12:22,961 --> 00:12:25,262
It's "puff, puff, pass," not
"puff, puff, stomp angrily."

285
00:12:25,297 --> 00:12:26,990
You brought pot to a crime scene?

286
00:12:27,025 --> 00:12:28,512
I most certainly did not.

287
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:29,356
I found it here.

288
00:12:29,391 --> 00:12:30,548
You found it?

289
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,837
You found it here at a crime scene?

290
00:12:31,872 --> 00:12:33,550
Yes, in the dung beetle's car.

291
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:34,964
You smoked evidence?

292
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:36,410
Well, it would've gone to waste otherwise.

293
00:12:36,445 --> 00:12:38,713
That's really good stuff you
just ground under your heel.

294
00:12:38,748 --> 00:12:41,980
Wow.

295
00:12:42,015 --> 00:12:43,595
Any sign he'd recently lit up?

296
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,459
Well, there was a... a
roach from another joint,

297
00:12:45,494 --> 00:12:46,554
freshly smoked.

298
00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:47,922
Nick's pupils weren't dilated.

299
00:12:47,957 --> 00:12:49,457
He didn't seem high.

300
00:12:49,492 --> 00:12:51,317
Maybe he wasn't alone. Where's the roach?

301
00:12:51,352 --> 00:12:52,893
Well, I added it to my joint.

302
00:12:54,077 --> 00:12:55,936
Well, it's the best part.

303
00:12:56,045 --> 00:12:58,385
So our only evidence is
currently in your lungs?

304
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,002
Uh, you really wanted to say
"up in smoke" then, didn't you?

305
00:13:01,037 --> 00:13:03,698
No. No, I most definitely did not.

306
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:04,846
Right, so what should we do now?

307
00:13:04,881 --> 00:13:06,013
I mean, we could head back to Lux.

308
00:13:06,048 --> 00:13:07,211
I'm sure there's some stragglers

309
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:09,210
we could get into trouble with, huh?

310
00:13:09,268 --> 00:13:11,401
I'm good, thanks.

311
00:13:11,893 --> 00:13:13,047
More for me, then.

312
00:13:43,165 --> 00:13:45,369
Hello, old friend.

313
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,591
Bloody hell.

314
00:13:53,589 --> 00:13:55,623
Brother, I'm disappointed in you.

315
00:13:55,658 --> 00:13:57,591
What?

316
00:13:57,627 --> 00:13:59,511
It's called a devil's
threesome for a reason.

317
00:13:59,546 --> 00:14:01,462
You were once the brightest of

318
00:14:01,523 --> 00:14:03,685
all of God's angels, Lucifer.

319
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,833
And now, look at you.

320
00:14:05,868 --> 00:14:08,494
Look, if you've come to lecture
me, can you just save it for later?

321
00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:10,045
I'm annoyingly sober right now,

322
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,959
and it takes ages to pour
a drink when you're around.

323
00:14:11,994 --> 00:14:14,041
- Actually, I'm here with an offer.
- Really?

324
00:14:14,076 --> 00:14:16,310
Go back to Hell, Lucifer,
and I will speak to Father.

325
00:14:16,345 --> 00:14:18,943
You're scared, aren't you?
That if I don't go back to Hell,

326
00:14:18,978 --> 00:14:20,338
you're gonna have to take over.

327
00:14:20,373 --> 00:14:21,785
Oh, that would never happen.

328
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,526
Oh, no, no, I mean, it's not
like God sent his favorite son

329
00:14:24,561 --> 00:14:26,257
to reign over Hell before, is it?

330
00:14:26,292 --> 00:14:27,999
Oh, wait, sorry.

331
00:14:28,045 --> 00:14:29,345
Forgot.

332
00:14:29,544 --> 00:14:30,729
So you can take your ultimatum

333
00:14:30,764 --> 00:14:32,897
and shove it up your feathered hole.

334
00:14:39,573 --> 00:14:41,935
You can't see it yet, can you?

335
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:44,939
- What's that?
- You saved a human life, Luci.

336
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,980
And not for any selfish reasons.

337
00:14:47,015 --> 00:14:50,678
No, you did it simply because
you cared about that detective.

338
00:14:52,782 --> 00:14:56,630
Your time here on Earth is
affecting you, dear brother.

339
00:14:56,665 --> 00:14:59,785
- You're changing.
- My life is change.

340
00:14:59,922 --> 00:15:02,289
"The same thing over and
over," that's your boring motto.

341
00:15:02,324 --> 00:15:05,612
True, but usually you're the
one controlling the change.

342
00:15:07,121 --> 00:15:08,596
This time, you're not.

343
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:11,031
Now, does that scare you?

344
00:15:11,067 --> 00:15:12,399
Because it should.

345
00:15:12,435 --> 00:15:16,239
You know, I am tired of your
dire warnings, all right?

346
00:15:16,312 --> 00:15:20,288
So just go rattle your
saber in someone else's face.

347
00:15:22,445 --> 00:15:24,078
You think about my offer.

348
00:15:24,113 --> 00:15:28,137
When you've made a decision,
you know how to find me.

349
00:15:49,672 --> 00:15:51,304
Hey, Robbie, where you been?

350
00:15:51,382 --> 00:15:52,648
If you're gonna follow me,

351
00:15:52,683 --> 00:15:54,650
maybe I can do something good with this.

352
00:15:55,027 --> 00:15:58,474
This... is the Web site for the Red Cross.

353
00:15:58,552 --> 00:16:00,577
Give blood, volunteer.

354
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,912
Don't be like the asshat filming this.

355
00:16:02,975 --> 00:16:04,216
Good job, kid.

356
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:05,331
Better than I did.

357
00:16:05,366 --> 00:16:06,954
- Mommy?
- Yeah, baby?

358
00:16:06,989 --> 00:16:08,700
Are you looking at a no-no site?

359
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:10,006
No. Why would you think that?

360
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,423
Because you put it away so fast,

361
00:16:12,462 --> 00:16:14,652
and you look really, really guilty.

362
00:16:14,687 --> 00:16:16,335
No, baby, I'm just doing police work.

363
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,098
I thought you weren't
supposed to be working.

364
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,704
And I thought you were
supposed to be getting ready

365
00:16:19,739 --> 00:16:22,303
to hang out with your dad.

366
00:16:22,338 --> 00:16:24,705
Who is early, apparently.

367
00:16:27,577 --> 00:16:28,825
Do you really live here?

368
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,828
I thought I must have
gotten the wrong address.

369
00:16:30,863 --> 00:16:32,813
How do you afford this place?

370
00:16:32,848 --> 00:16:33,989
Do you take bribes?

371
00:16:34,024 --> 00:16:36,051
I don't. And what are you doing here?

372
00:16:36,086 --> 00:16:36,850
Lucifer!

373
00:16:36,886 --> 00:16:39,520
Ah, hello again, small human.

374
00:16:40,489 --> 00:16:42,960
Uh, this-this is yours, yes?

375
00:16:42,995 --> 00:16:44,653
Yeah, that's Molly McDowell.

376
00:16:44,688 --> 00:16:46,312
She's a ballerina by day,

377
00:16:46,347 --> 00:16:47,961
but a ninja chemist by night.

378
00:16:47,996 --> 00:16:49,624
When a simple yes would've sufficed.

379
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:51,191
Right, on you go, then. Go on, fetch away.

380
00:16:52,913 --> 00:16:54,408
Well, go on, then.

381
00:16:54,443 --> 00:16:56,085
Uh, is this too advanced for her?

382
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,005
You're funny.

383
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,476
Trixie, babe, come on.

384
00:17:00,511 --> 00:17:02,369
Get ready.

385
00:17:02,436 --> 00:17:04,636
You need to leave now.

386
00:17:04,728 --> 00:17:07,474
I had no idea that <i>Hot Tub
High School</i> paid so well.

387
00:17:07,509 --> 00:17:10,017
It didn't. And can you
shh on the <i>Hot Tub?</i>

388
00:17:10,052 --> 00:17:11,077
She doesn't know.

389
00:17:11,112 --> 00:17:12,752
What, that her mom was a giant star?

390
00:17:12,787 --> 00:17:14,053
Why not?

391
00:17:14,107 --> 00:17:16,538
Not 'cause of the old...?

392
00:17:16,632 --> 00:17:18,489
Yeah. And can you never do that again?

393
00:17:18,524 --> 00:17:21,400
Right, sorry. So how do
you afford this place?

394
00:17:21,435 --> 00:17:23,017
I don't; it's my mother's.

395
00:17:23,052 --> 00:17:26,180
I moved in after Dan and I separated, okay?

396
00:17:27,236 --> 00:17:28,595
Penelope Decker?

397
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,808
Hold on a minute.

398
00:17:29,843 --> 00:17:31,557
Your mother's Penelope Decker?

399
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,407
- Queen of '80s cheeseball sci-fi?
- Yeah.

400
00:17:33,442 --> 00:17:35,743
You have to introduce me.

401
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,512
Mm, I don't.

402
00:17:37,547 --> 00:17:38,931
- And I probably won't.
- So you're part of a

403
00:17:38,966 --> 00:17:41,513
family dynasty like me. No
wonder we get on so well.

404
00:17:41,548 --> 00:17:42,748
How did you rebel?

405
00:17:42,783 --> 00:17:44,666
- What do you mean?
- Well, you're mad at the dung beetle.

406
00:17:44,701 --> 00:17:47,447
You must have done something
salacious in your youth.

407
00:17:47,482 --> 00:17:48,288
What was it?

408
00:17:48,324 --> 00:17:49,723
Did you kiss a girl and like it?

409
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:51,240
I don't want to talk about it.

410
00:17:51,275 --> 00:17:52,739
Oh, so there is something.

411
00:17:52,774 --> 00:17:53,560
Two girls?

412
00:17:53,635 --> 00:17:55,468
- Okay.
- An Eiffel Tower?

413
00:17:56,699 --> 00:17:58,124
What's an Eiffel Tower?

414
00:17:58,159 --> 00:17:59,968
It's marvelous. It's
when two chaps high-five

415
00:18:00,003 --> 00:18:01,124
at the top, then the young lady...

416
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:03,065
Okay, there is an
eight-year-old in the room

417
00:18:03,154 --> 00:18:04,568
who doesn't need to hear
about an Eiffel Tower.

418
00:18:04,603 --> 00:18:06,436
What...? What about the case?

419
00:18:06,471 --> 00:18:09,043
If I were secretly working
on it, having you around

420
00:18:09,078 --> 00:18:10,971
drawing attention
wouldn't be good, would it?

421
00:18:11,061 --> 00:18:13,165
Well, maybe not, but be much
more fun, wouldn't it, Detective,

422
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,020
if we carried on working together?

423
00:18:15,055 --> 00:18:16,821
Detective?

424
00:18:18,187 --> 00:18:19,153
Detective?

425
00:18:19,188 --> 00:18:20,477
Mm-hmm.

426
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,199
I understand.

427
00:18:22,525 --> 00:18:24,458
Mm-hmm.

428
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:25,463
Hello, there.

429
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,917
I'd very much like to see Nick Hofmeister.

430
00:18:28,015 --> 00:18:31,012
I'm afraid I can't... Oh.

431
00:18:32,523 --> 00:18:33,567
Hello.

432
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:34,699
Hello to you.

433
00:18:34,734 --> 00:18:35,531
Hello?

434
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:41,916
Afternoon, dung beetle.

435
00:18:44,278 --> 00:18:45,835
We need to talk.

436
00:18:46,601 --> 00:18:49,643
I, um, I'm not gonna
tell you anything, man.

437
00:18:49,678 --> 00:18:51,257
No, no, no, I don't want
to know about the case,

438
00:18:51,347 --> 00:18:54,548
so you can keep your dirty little secrets.

439
00:18:54,704 --> 00:18:57,468
No, I'd like to know about Chloe Decker.

440
00:18:57,963 --> 00:19:00,827
And you're gonna tell me everything.

441
00:19:05,856 --> 00:19:07,391
I have an effect on people.

442
00:19:07,456 --> 00:19:08,781
It's a way of pulling out

443
00:19:08,816 --> 00:19:12,175
their deepest desires,
revealing the truth within.

444
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,840
It works on everyone.

445
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,420
Everyone except for Chloe Decker.

446
00:19:15,475 --> 00:19:17,611
And I suspect it's somehow related

447
00:19:17,646 --> 00:19:19,457
to my recent bouts of humanity.

448
00:19:19,554 --> 00:19:20,762
What does this have to do with me?

449
00:19:20,797 --> 00:19:22,269
Well, you know everything
about her, don't you?

450
00:19:22,304 --> 00:19:23,944
All her sordid secrets.

451
00:19:24,045 --> 00:19:25,285
I'm hoping they'll help me understand

452
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,060
why she's so frustratingly
immune to my charms.

453
00:19:28,131 --> 00:19:30,246
Chloe doesn't have any sordid secrets.

454
00:19:32,486 --> 00:19:35,391
I've seen the hatred in her
eyes when she looks at you.

455
00:19:35,426 --> 00:19:37,909
Come on. You must have something.

456
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:39,777
Do you know what happened when she was 19?

457
00:19:39,854 --> 00:19:41,307
She starred in <i>Hot Tub High School</i>

458
00:19:41,342 --> 00:19:44,047
and revealed her rather
spectacular assets to the world.

459
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:45,883
Right.

460
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,140
And two weeks later, her father died.

461
00:19:49,998 --> 00:19:51,014
Oh.

462
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:52,675
Yeah, so I knew, of course,

463
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,307
everyone in the world was gonna try to get

464
00:19:54,342 --> 00:19:57,275
a... shot of them leaving the funeral.

465
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:00,553
And I really... I really
wanted to be first.

466
00:20:00,588 --> 00:20:02,731
Oh, dung beetle, tell me you didn't.

467
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,686
Yeah, I crashed the funeral.

468
00:20:04,721 --> 00:20:08,061
And... she... oh, she flipped out.

469
00:20:08,096 --> 00:20:09,507
But I got my photo.

470
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:10,926
Right when she punched the lens.

471
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:12,886
I mean, right then... it
cracked the lens right in half.

472
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:16,314
- I made so much money off that photo.
- I'm sure.

473
00:20:19,015 --> 00:20:23,400
Yeah, but at what cost to my soul, right?

474
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:27,444
And that'll be for someone else to decide.

475
00:20:27,479 --> 00:20:28,562
Yeah.

476
00:20:28,597 --> 00:20:30,442
Well, that someone else
is sitting opposite you,

477
00:20:30,477 --> 00:20:32,052
and it's not looking good.

478
00:20:32,087 --> 00:20:33,498
I crossed a line.

479
00:20:33,579 --> 00:20:34,630
And I knew it.

480
00:20:34,665 --> 00:20:36,229
And after that, I just
did everything I could

481
00:20:36,305 --> 00:20:38,608
to keep others from making
the same mistakes I did.

482
00:20:38,643 --> 00:20:40,276
That's why I...

483
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,708
Why what?

484
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:45,501
- No, it's...
- You want to tell me.

485
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:46,848
- It's nothing.
- Who are you protecting

486
00:20:46,882 --> 00:20:48,796
- from following in your footsteps?
- I can't.

487
00:20:48,822 --> 00:20:51,894
- It's... I just... I can't.
- You want to tell me, don't you?

488
00:20:52,035 --> 00:20:53,661
- I really can't.
- You want to tell me.

489
00:20:53,697 --> 00:20:54,810
Who are you protecting?

490
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:55,822
Who are you protecting?

491
00:20:55,852 --> 00:20:57,358
How are you doing this, man?

492
00:20:57,398 --> 00:20:58,698
Look at me.

493
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:00,191
Who are you protecting?

494
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:01,212
Please, just...

495
00:21:01,247 --> 00:21:02,960
- Look at me. Look at me.
- I won't. I won't.

496
00:21:02,996 --> 00:21:04,362
- I can't.
- Look at me!

497
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:05,830
Leave me alone!

498
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,687
I already spoke to the police about Robbie.

499
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,411
I don't know what else there is to say.

500
00:21:21,148 --> 00:21:22,714
I'm just following up.

501
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:25,049
I want to make sure there aren't
any suspects we overlooked.

502
00:21:25,085 --> 00:21:27,518
But I was told Nick Hofmeister confessed.

503
00:21:28,536 --> 00:21:29,935
He did.

504
00:21:31,379 --> 00:21:35,174
Mr. Russell, I, um...

505
00:21:35,757 --> 00:21:37,873
I don't think Nick killed your son.

506
00:21:37,908 --> 00:21:39,497
What?

507
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:42,217
Are you... Is this a joke?

508
00:21:42,498 --> 00:21:44,167
I'm sorry.

509
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:47,711
Y-You just don't know

510
00:21:47,972 --> 00:21:51,007
what Robbie went through
because of my work.

511
00:21:51,653 --> 00:21:53,891
Now he's dead because of me.

512
00:21:54,001 --> 00:21:55,046
No.

513
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:58,017
You know, my mom is Penelope Decker.

514
00:21:58,129 --> 00:22:00,084
So I was followed by paparazzi all my life,

515
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,019
just like Robbie.

516
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:04,085
But, you know, that wasn't my mom's fault.

517
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,574
And you got to know, it's
not your fault either.

518
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,792
The only person you can blame

519
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,946
is whoever ran your son off the road.

520
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:12,451
I want to make sure we get the right guy.

521
00:22:12,486 --> 00:22:15,287
And I'm telling you, I
don't think Nick is him.

522
00:22:17,107 --> 00:22:19,203
There was one other paparazzo.

523
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,001
Did you get a name or a description?

524
00:22:21,036 --> 00:22:21,714
No, I didn't.

525
00:22:21,776 --> 00:22:24,154
Because Robbie only noticed him once.

526
00:22:24,189 --> 00:22:26,589
That's why I never mentioned him before.

527
00:22:27,739 --> 00:22:29,013
Thank you.

528
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:32,550
Excuse me.

529
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,522
Decker.

530
00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:41,058
He did what?

531
00:22:50,003 --> 00:22:51,469
What is wrong with you?

532
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,217
Nothing is wrong with me.

533
00:22:54,252 --> 00:22:56,511
I was hoping for sexy, salacious details,

534
00:22:56,546 --> 00:23:00,047
and instead I got taken on
a trip down depression lane.

535
00:23:01,393 --> 00:23:04,875
You feel bad for invading her privacy?

536
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:07,310
You're the Lord of Hell.

537
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:10,744
I can't believe I'm saying
this, but Amenadiel is right.

538
00:23:10,966 --> 00:23:12,911
You are changing.

539
00:23:12,946 --> 00:23:15,159
I don't mind the odd
smart-assed remark, Maze.

540
00:23:15,195 --> 00:23:16,252
They can be quite amusing.

541
00:23:16,287 --> 00:23:18,710
But don't you dare disrespect me.

542
00:23:18,745 --> 00:23:20,448
Or what?

543
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:22,203
You'll cry really hard on my shoulder?

544
00:23:22,238 --> 00:23:24,605
You will not speak to me this way!

545
00:23:26,773 --> 00:23:29,340
There he is.

546
00:23:31,596 --> 00:23:34,435
How did you get into Nick's holding cell?

547
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:36,214
And there he goes.

548
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:37,415
Oh, sorry.

549
00:23:37,507 --> 00:23:40,573
Am I interrupting some
creepy foreplay you two have?

550
00:23:40,608 --> 00:23:42,797
How did you get into Nick's holding cell?

551
00:23:42,832 --> 00:23:44,589
Why, by asking very nicely, of course.

552
00:23:44,624 --> 00:23:46,141
Something you should try sometime.

553
00:23:46,228 --> 00:23:49,227
This case has nothing to do with you.

554
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:50,588
Why won't you leave it alone?

555
00:23:50,643 --> 00:23:52,243
Why won't you?

556
00:23:52,927 --> 00:23:54,498
Did you learn something, at least?

557
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,635
Yes. I did, actually.

558
00:23:57,774 --> 00:23:59,178
Our dung beetle is protecting

559
00:23:59,248 --> 00:24:02,235
someone who's following in his footsteps.

560
00:24:02,322 --> 00:24:03,642
Protégé, perhaps.

561
00:24:03,706 --> 00:24:05,615
I found out someone else
was following Robbie,

562
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,484
and someone's been uploading photos online

563
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:09,752
today from Nick's company.

564
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,383
Last one was posted an hour ago

565
00:24:11,418 --> 00:24:13,985
from a party that's still happening.

566
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,717
Our killer could be there.

567
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,272
Right.

568
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:19,390
Are you coming or what?

569
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:21,465
Oh, sorry, I thought this was
the part where you leave me behind

570
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,064
and say something like, "Lucifer, stay.

571
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:25,686
- Good devil."
- I'd rather keep my eye on you.

572
00:24:42,709 --> 00:24:45,949
So how do you plan on catching
our murderous protégé anyway?

573
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,830
Well, I was thinking, what if he
never left the scene of the crime?

574
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:52,264
What, and instead blended in with
the other paparazzi taking photos?

575
00:24:52,299 --> 00:24:53,997
That's quite clever.

576
00:24:54,032 --> 00:24:57,767
Yeah, so if we recognize anyone
from the crash, it could be our guy.

577
00:24:57,802 --> 00:24:59,295
Right.

578
00:25:01,768 --> 00:25:03,434
Are you okay?

579
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:04,835
I'm fine.

580
00:25:05,089 --> 00:25:06,638
Why?

581
00:25:07,664 --> 00:25:09,952
Oh, Nick told you what happened, didn't he?

582
00:25:10,107 --> 00:25:11,163
He did.

583
00:25:11,265 --> 00:25:13,744
Got to hear all about
your wicked right hook.

584
00:25:13,923 --> 00:25:15,005
Oh, yeah.

585
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,207
He also told me it was a low point for him.

586
00:25:17,242 --> 00:25:19,254
Which I believe, actually.

587
00:25:19,372 --> 00:25:21,585
Yeah, I think our dung
beetle, of all things,

588
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,621
desires redemption for what he did to you.

589
00:25:25,161 --> 00:25:26,958
Yeah, well, he's not going
about it the right way,

590
00:25:26,993 --> 00:25:29,308
- that's for sure.
- Yes, well, we all know

591
00:25:29,389 --> 00:25:32,269
what the road to Hell
is paved with, don't we?

592
00:25:33,013 --> 00:25:34,927
Hello, hello, hello.

593
00:25:35,143 --> 00:25:36,859
There's a familiar face.

594
00:25:36,984 --> 00:25:39,603
Yeah, from the crime scene this morning.

595
00:25:39,834 --> 00:25:42,923
- I remember him.
- And he's spectacularly creepy as well,

596
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:43,749
so that's a bonus.

597
00:25:43,784 --> 00:25:45,830
Hey, everybody, it's Chloe Decker!

598
00:25:45,865 --> 00:25:47,078
Penelope Decker's daughter!

599
00:25:48,281 --> 00:25:49,881
- Chloe, look over here!
- Guys...

600
00:25:49,936 --> 00:25:50,819
- Back off.
- Chloe Decker!

601
00:25:50,854 --> 00:25:52,901
- Hey, show me your boobs!
- Hey, show us your boobs, Chloe!

602
00:25:52,936 --> 00:25:55,436
Back off, you mouth-breathing scaven...!

603
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:58,686
Well, go on then, punch him!
Come on, let's punch them all!

604
00:25:58,819 --> 00:26:00,507
It's not me anymore.

605
00:26:00,542 --> 00:26:03,828
Well, it's still very much me.

606
00:26:03,863 --> 00:26:05,196
You, Friar Tuck,

607
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:08,823
tell me, is this depravity
really all you want out of life?

608
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,433
Hmm?

609
00:26:11,589 --> 00:26:14,323
I want to win a Pulitzer for photography.

610
00:26:14,358 --> 00:26:15,373
Pulitzer?

611
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:16,782
Really? Do you hear that, chaps?

612
00:26:16,817 --> 00:26:20,334
Yeah, they don't give out
Pulitzers for nip slips.

613
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:36,423
He's gone.

614
00:26:43,911 --> 00:26:45,710
Oh, boy.

615
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,055
It's not that bad, is it?

616
00:26:48,164 --> 00:26:50,353
Trixie's classmates all have the Internet.

617
00:26:50,388 --> 00:26:51,860
One of them's gonna
figure out that her mom is

618
00:26:51,895 --> 00:26:54,082
the top story on their
favorite gossip site.

619
00:26:54,117 --> 00:26:57,192
She's finally gonna find out
about <i>Hot Tub High School.</i>

620
00:26:57,227 --> 00:26:58,725
- Great.
- If it's any consolation,

621
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,976
you look really good in it.

622
00:27:00,011 --> 00:27:01,544
Thanks.

623
00:27:02,541 --> 00:27:05,589
Why do I feel like you're
cheering me up for even worse news?

624
00:27:05,894 --> 00:27:07,199
Nick's sticking to his story.

625
00:27:07,234 --> 00:27:08,474
It's an open-
and-shut case,

626
00:27:08,509 --> 00:27:11,314
but I can't help it if a rogue detective

627
00:27:11,349 --> 00:27:13,550
won't leave well enough alone.

628
00:27:15,776 --> 00:27:17,262
Oh, you ran the plate number I gave you.

629
00:27:17,297 --> 00:27:18,406
Yes, ma'am, I did.

630
00:27:18,441 --> 00:27:20,633
It was registered to Nick...
one of his company cars.

631
00:27:20,668 --> 00:27:22,526
Like the one that ran Robbie off the road?

632
00:27:22,561 --> 00:27:23,479
Exactly.

633
00:27:23,514 --> 00:27:24,337
Did a little more digging.

634
00:27:24,372 --> 00:27:27,936
Guy's name is Josh Bryant.
He freelances for Nick.

635
00:27:27,971 --> 00:27:29,437
Thanks.

636
00:27:31,552 --> 00:27:33,217
Why are you doing this?

637
00:27:33,252 --> 00:27:35,224
Because I think you're onto something.

638
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:38,641
So go figure it out
while I buy you some time.

639
00:27:38,676 --> 00:27:41,120
And... be careful.

640
00:27:41,155 --> 00:27:42,762
All right?

641
00:27:57,305 --> 00:28:00,806
Oh, sorry. Did I ruin
your creepy little moment?

642
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:05,598
I am so happy to see you.

643
00:28:05,964 --> 00:28:08,117
I felt so bad about what happened.

644
00:28:08,152 --> 00:28:09,438
I'm a huge fan.

645
00:28:09,473 --> 00:28:11,803
<i>Hot Tub High School</i>
was my favorite growing up.

646
00:28:11,838 --> 00:28:12,876
Yes, we're really not interested

647
00:28:12,911 --> 00:28:15,040
in your formative spank
bank years, all right?

648
00:28:15,153 --> 00:28:16,802
I'm so sorry about what happened.

649
00:28:16,837 --> 00:28:19,237
I would've done something,
but I'm not good with violence.

650
00:28:19,273 --> 00:28:19,859
Mm.

651
00:28:19,894 --> 00:28:22,040
Well, lucky for us, we found you anyhow.

652
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,582
You were looking for me? Why?

653
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,256
Because she wants justice
for Robbie Russell Jr.

654
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:28,694
What is it you want, Josh?

655
00:28:28,729 --> 00:28:30,949
Hmm?

656
00:28:30,984 --> 00:28:32,926
To be first.

657
00:28:32,994 --> 00:28:34,770
To always be first.

658
00:28:34,805 --> 00:28:36,271
Really?

659
00:28:37,564 --> 00:28:39,190
What, did Nick teach you that?

660
00:28:39,326 --> 00:28:40,759
To be first?

661
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,895
Yeah. I learned a lot working for him.

662
00:28:42,989 --> 00:28:44,162
He's my idol.

663
00:28:44,197 --> 00:28:45,438
He's the best pap out there.

664
00:28:45,511 --> 00:28:48,778
So you took photos of your
idol being arrested for murder?

665
00:28:48,813 --> 00:28:50,742
I didn't know what else to do.

666
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,306
Other than what Nick would've done.

667
00:28:52,409 --> 00:28:54,107
Which is to be first, no matter what.

668
00:28:54,142 --> 00:28:55,533
Of course.

669
00:28:55,658 --> 00:28:57,275
Just a second.

670
00:29:06,253 --> 00:29:07,845
You like smoking pot, Josh?

671
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,689
It's for my nerves. I have a prescription.

672
00:29:13,677 --> 00:29:14,459
Oh!

673
00:29:14,494 --> 00:29:15,360
Hello.

674
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,269
Good timing on that photo.

675
00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:22,701
Just lucky I guess.

676
00:29:25,771 --> 00:29:29,307
Far be it for me to call someone's
morality into question, but...

677
00:29:29,343 --> 00:29:32,310
I believe that photo was planned.

678
00:29:32,346 --> 00:29:34,796
Yeah.

679
00:29:34,964 --> 00:29:37,664
Makes me wonder what else was.

680
00:29:39,586 --> 00:29:41,519
Look at this.

681
00:29:41,555 --> 00:29:43,262
Celebrity shouting matches,

682
00:29:43,297 --> 00:29:44,355
fistfights.

683
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:46,766
Josh had the first photo on every one.

684
00:29:46,801 --> 00:29:47,926
It escalates.

685
00:29:47,961 --> 00:29:49,348
Overdose. Suicide.

686
00:29:49,383 --> 00:29:50,819
- Or so it appeared.
- Well, I suppose

687
00:29:50,854 --> 00:29:53,485
the best way to be first is to
know it'll happen beforehand.

688
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,468
So he follows Robbie, intent
on running him off the road,

689
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:59,604
but doesn't count on his
own car running off as well.

690
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,339
This is cold, premeditated murder.

691
00:30:01,374 --> 00:30:02,711
- Mm.
- Nick's a slimeball.

692
00:30:02,746 --> 00:30:05,377
I just... I don't think he'd go this far.

693
00:30:05,485 --> 00:30:07,616
Which means Josh maybe
convinced him to take the fall.

694
00:30:07,651 --> 00:30:08,885
The question is: why?

695
00:30:08,937 --> 00:30:10,148
Well, who cares?

696
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,442
We know Josh is guilty. Let's punish him.

697
00:30:12,527 --> 00:30:15,230
Ah, I could add an ironic twist,
like I used to when I ran Hell.

698
00:30:15,265 --> 00:30:16,861
Yeah, no, it doesn't work that way,

699
00:30:16,896 --> 00:30:18,024
because I need evidence.

700
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:19,558
Well, you have plenty.

701
00:30:19,593 --> 00:30:20,762
Circumstantial.

702
00:30:20,797 --> 00:30:22,853
I need concrete proof.

703
00:30:22,888 --> 00:30:23,729
I'm gonna talk to Nick...

704
00:30:23,764 --> 00:30:25,227
Boring, boring, boring, boring!

705
00:30:25,262 --> 00:30:27,358
You don't decide who gets punished and how.

706
00:30:27,393 --> 00:30:30,368
- That's exactly what I do.
- No, no, you don't.

707
00:30:30,544 --> 00:30:32,744
This is how it works, Lucifer.

708
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,271
Whatever speech you have brewing, Maze,

709
00:30:42,306 --> 00:30:44,907
I don't want to hear it.

710
00:30:45,085 --> 00:30:48,221
I think I've said everything I need to.

711
00:30:50,753 --> 00:30:52,220
You're right.

712
00:30:52,427 --> 00:30:53,728
And I agree.

713
00:30:53,763 --> 00:30:55,760
Let's go deliver some punishment.

714
00:31:01,248 --> 00:31:04,709
We believe Josh may be a
very disturbed individual.

715
00:31:06,005 --> 00:31:07,939
God.

716
00:31:07,974 --> 00:31:09,659
He caused all these?

717
00:31:09,694 --> 00:31:11,952
Yeah. All of them.

718
00:31:12,061 --> 00:31:13,979
I can't believe it. I...

719
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,621
Tell me what really happened, Nick.

720
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:22,332
I took Josh in when he was 16.

721
00:31:22,367 --> 00:31:23,822
He was a runaway.

722
00:31:23,857 --> 00:31:27,582
He was a little broken.

723
00:31:27,715 --> 00:31:32,530
In him, I saw a little
bit of who I used to be.

724
00:31:32,566 --> 00:31:35,734
At least, I thought I did.

725
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:37,569
So I took him under my wing.

726
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:40,038
He was a natural.

727
00:31:40,073 --> 00:31:42,783
Taught him about all the
lines a pap can't cross.

728
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:45,564
You know, 'cause I just...
I just wanted him to stop

729
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:47,600
making the same mistakes I did.

730
00:31:47,714 --> 00:31:50,313
- Mm.
- And then, two days ago,

731
00:31:50,382 --> 00:31:52,915
he calls me up, says he's
been in a really bad accident,

732
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:55,083
and said that he totally understood

733
00:31:55,118 --> 00:31:57,485
everything I was saying now.

734
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,388
But it was too late.

735
00:31:59,445 --> 00:32:01,770
You know, someone was dead.

736
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:02,990
So you took the fall,

737
00:32:03,077 --> 00:32:06,214
hoping that Josh would
get a chance at a new life.

738
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:07,416
Yeah.

739
00:32:07,493 --> 00:32:11,036
Nick Hofmeister finally tries to
do something good with his life,

740
00:32:11,071 --> 00:32:13,438
and he gets played.

741
00:32:13,529 --> 00:32:15,398
You must really be enjoying this.

742
00:32:15,445 --> 00:32:17,266
I'm really not.

743
00:32:17,331 --> 00:32:21,111
Believe it or not, I forgive you.

744
00:32:21,244 --> 00:32:23,246
This isn't about you, this isn't about me.

745
00:32:23,362 --> 00:32:24,816
This is about Robbie Russell.

746
00:32:24,917 --> 00:32:27,470
You know, he was a kid who
didn't ask to be famous.

747
00:32:27,505 --> 00:32:31,183
He just wanted to live a normal life.

748
00:32:32,493 --> 00:32:36,105
Nick, if you don't testify,
Josh will do this again.

749
00:32:37,124 --> 00:32:38,830
He'll do it again.

750
00:32:41,268 --> 00:32:43,802
Excuse me.

751
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:46,258
Oh. Just a second.

752
00:32:47,094 --> 00:32:48,257
Hey, Dan, this better be important.

753
00:32:48,292 --> 00:32:50,290
I think Nick's about to talk.

754
00:32:51,812 --> 00:32:54,746
No, I'm not following Josh. Why?

755
00:32:55,061 --> 00:32:56,900
What do you mean he's missing?

756
00:33:04,633 --> 00:33:06,015
Desk Sergeant?

757
00:33:06,145 --> 00:33:07,918
- Yes, Detective?
- Where did Nick Hofmeister go?

758
00:33:07,999 --> 00:33:09,915
- Did somebody get him?
- Why, yes.

759
00:33:10,014 --> 00:33:12,548
It was that tall, handsome British fella.

760
00:33:13,271 --> 00:33:17,345
Oh, no. I did it, too, didn't I?

761
00:33:39,734 --> 00:33:43,071
Oh, I respect what you do, dung beetle.

762
00:33:43,106 --> 00:33:44,764
Much as celebrities hate you,

763
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,401
you know, they need you,
keep you in the limelight.

764
00:33:48,645 --> 00:33:51,346
You're a... a necessarily evil.

765
00:33:51,473 --> 00:33:53,835
Something I understand all too well.

766
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:56,361
But the-the trouble is
that you tried to change.

767
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:59,831
Yeah? And you failed spectacularly at it.

768
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:03,525
Because, well, sometimes
we are what we are,

769
00:34:04,263 --> 00:34:06,630
and we should embrace that.

770
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,776
What are we doing back here exactly?

771
00:34:10,811 --> 00:34:12,067
And do you need me to...?

772
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,002
Maze!

773
00:34:14,935 --> 00:34:17,469
Did you bring me my gift?

774
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:33,769
I'll kill you, you crazy bitch.

775
00:34:35,064 --> 00:34:36,230
Just be polite to the lady.

776
00:34:36,334 --> 00:34:38,467
She isn't your enemy tonight.

777
00:34:39,948 --> 00:34:41,847
What is this?

778
00:34:41,932 --> 00:34:45,909
Right, well, both of you have committed
terrible acts worthy of punishment.

779
00:34:45,944 --> 00:34:48,436
However, you will not receive
said punishment when you die.

780
00:34:48,472 --> 00:34:50,841
It's my fault, really. Sorry.

781
00:34:50,965 --> 00:34:52,891
So I'm here to fix that.

782
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,760
Right now.

783
00:34:57,419 --> 00:34:59,156
Oh. Amateurs.

784
00:34:59,242 --> 00:35:01,612
All right, very well, in
terms you'll understand.

785
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:05,324
You both get a gun.

786
00:35:05,472 --> 00:35:08,188
Let's see who shoots who first.

787
00:35:14,882 --> 00:35:17,003
What's to stop us from shooting you?

788
00:35:17,038 --> 00:35:20,053
Well, despite the waste
of bullets, let's see.

789
00:35:20,202 --> 00:35:22,483
He's about to rat you out to the police.

790
00:35:22,518 --> 00:35:26,308
And he tricked you into taking
the fall for a murder he committed.

791
00:35:26,343 --> 00:35:27,776
Discuss.

792
00:35:29,748 --> 00:35:32,014
You really did it, didn't you?

793
00:35:32,954 --> 00:35:34,653
You killed people.

794
00:35:37,196 --> 00:35:38,874
You lost your touch, Nick.

795
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:41,821
All this talk about lines we can't cross.

796
00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:43,758
Nowadays, the only way to be first

797
00:35:43,794 --> 00:35:46,428
is to realize that there <i>is</i> no line.

798
00:35:46,463 --> 00:35:50,665
And you were almost
begging to take the fall.

799
00:35:50,701 --> 00:35:52,769
That one dramatic gesture.

800
00:35:52,848 --> 00:35:55,270
As if that would erase the fact
that you've been a piece of crap

801
00:35:55,305 --> 00:35:57,305
- for the last 30 years.
- You can't do this.

802
00:35:57,395 --> 00:35:59,628
I treated you like a son.

803
00:36:02,988 --> 00:36:06,181
Oh, Maze, you fiend.

804
00:36:06,361 --> 00:36:07,965
Even I didn't see that one coming.

805
00:36:08,025 --> 00:36:10,304
You really would've killed me.

806
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,094
Nick...

807
00:36:19,265 --> 00:36:21,496
I made a mistake, okay? I realize that now.

808
00:36:21,531 --> 00:36:22,950
And I'm sorry.

809
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:25,667
Stop! Don't shoot him!

810
00:36:25,726 --> 00:36:28,370
Detective, you're
interrupting my punishment.

811
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,654
You, don't talk. You're lucky
I figured out your insane,

812
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:32,528
ironic punishment before anyone got killed.

813
00:36:32,602 --> 00:36:35,411
Nick, you tried to do some good,

814
00:36:35,446 --> 00:36:37,134
to help someone. Don't throw it all away.

815
00:36:37,222 --> 00:36:39,684
Nick, embrace who you really
are. Stop fighting it. Come on.

816
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:42,304
Don't listen to him,
Nick. You tried to change.

817
00:36:42,339 --> 00:36:43,639
Yeah.

818
00:36:43,741 --> 00:36:45,049
- And look what happened.
- Yeah.

819
00:36:45,084 --> 00:36:46,819
You screwed up, but you
know what? It's okay.

820
00:36:46,923 --> 00:36:48,926
You tried to change.
That's what's important.

821
00:36:48,961 --> 00:36:50,994
Humans.

822
00:36:51,215 --> 00:36:53,716
Fascinating, aren't they?

823
00:36:54,425 --> 00:36:56,002
Do you know, perhaps
they're onto something.

824
00:36:56,054 --> 00:36:59,252
Nick... don't.

825
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,818
I was surprised to hear from you, Lucifer.

826
00:37:16,909 --> 00:37:19,754
Well, not as surprised as I was.

827
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:21,956
But I wanted to tell you you were right.

828
00:37:21,992 --> 00:37:24,160
Hmm. Is that a joke?

829
00:37:24,311 --> 00:37:26,244
No, I wish it were.

830
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:29,397
But, no, you were right, and I was wrong.

831
00:37:33,742 --> 00:37:35,150
So you'll return to Hell?

832
00:37:35,272 --> 00:37:37,172
What? No!

833
00:37:37,207 --> 00:37:38,796
That is absurd.

834
00:37:38,899 --> 00:37:41,143
No, you're right that I've
changed in my time here,

835
00:37:41,257 --> 00:37:44,158
and that I have absolutely
no control over it.

836
00:37:44,884 --> 00:37:46,530
And you know what?

837
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:52,336
That feels positively thrilling.

838
00:37:52,707 --> 00:37:54,890
You asked me here to tell me that?

839
00:37:55,253 --> 00:37:56,211
No, no, no, I thought

840
00:37:56,309 --> 00:37:58,782
I'd use you to remedy a
situation that I've mishandled,

841
00:37:58,872 --> 00:38:01,439
and annoy you in the process.

842
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,827
Kill two birds with one
prayer sort of thing, hmm?

843
00:38:03,934 --> 00:38:06,634
Luci...

844
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:08,536
you should've taken the offer.

845
00:38:08,572 --> 00:38:11,239
Oh.

846
00:38:26,323 --> 00:38:28,642
You're looking for someone?

847
00:38:30,293 --> 00:38:33,061
But...

848
00:38:33,124 --> 00:38:34,896
you were just over there.

849
00:38:35,005 --> 00:38:38,406
That's... that's impossible.

850
00:38:57,199 --> 00:38:58,684
Yes?

851
00:38:59,095 --> 00:39:00,823
I saw Nick pull the trigger.

852
00:39:00,956 --> 00:39:03,489
I heard the gunshot, but Josh wasn't shot.

853
00:39:03,566 --> 00:39:05,920
Did you put blanks in the guns? Like...

854
00:39:05,955 --> 00:39:08,393
Was this some staged thing to
get a confession out of Josh?

855
00:39:08,428 --> 00:39:11,086
That's probably more plausible
to you than my angelic brother

856
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:13,337
slowing time while I pluck
a bullet out of thin air,

857
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,701
isn't it?

858
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:18,237
Even with all that,

859
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:20,706
you were standing right in front of me.

860
00:39:20,742 --> 00:39:23,109
I blink, and you're here.

861
00:39:23,144 --> 00:39:24,911
Is there a question there, Detective?

862
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:27,282
You...

863
00:39:27,381 --> 00:39:29,367
You know exactly what I'm asking you.

864
00:39:29,445 --> 00:39:31,938
And you know exactly what I'll answer.

865
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:34,387
You know, um...

866
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:38,063
it's quite fun, this
police malarkey, isn't it?

867
00:39:38,633 --> 00:39:41,027
Are we going to watch a movie, Mommy?

868
00:39:41,062 --> 00:39:43,429
No, babe, I just wanted to
talk to you about something.

869
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,632
So, before I was a cop,

870
00:39:46,708 --> 00:39:48,669
I was an actress.

871
00:39:48,704 --> 00:39:50,390
And I was in a movie.

872
00:39:50,478 --> 00:39:53,607
And... it was this movie.

873
00:39:53,693 --> 00:39:58,070
In the movie, I do some very silly things.

874
00:39:58,105 --> 00:39:59,777
Things that, uh,

875
00:39:59,812 --> 00:40:03,018
maybe some of your friends
might tease you about.

876
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:05,320
But it is what it is,

877
00:40:05,417 --> 00:40:08,430
and-and that's not me anymore, okay?

878
00:40:09,636 --> 00:40:10,923
I know.

879
00:40:10,959 --> 00:40:11,958
Hmm?

880
00:40:12,299 --> 00:40:14,575
I've seen this before, Mommy.

881
00:40:15,403 --> 00:40:17,400
You have? Where?

882
00:40:17,435 --> 00:40:20,271
I have the Internet.

883
00:40:20,399 --> 00:40:21,832
Oh, right.

884
00:40:21,867 --> 00:40:25,102
This isn't even in HD.

885
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:28,241
Mm. Hmm.

886
00:40:29,112 --> 00:40:31,032
Well, what'd you think?

887
00:40:31,212 --> 00:40:33,410
I thought it's hilarious!

888
00:40:33,996 --> 00:40:34,914
You did?

889
00:40:34,985 --> 00:40:36,985
My favorite part is when
you ate too much cake,

890
00:40:37,115 --> 00:40:39,452
and then you puked in that cute guy's hair.

891
00:40:40,892 --> 00:40:42,984
That part is really funny.

892
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:46,817
Then you stop, and we think it's all over.

893
00:40:46,852 --> 00:40:48,037
Yeah.

894
00:40:48,215 --> 00:40:49,512
But then...

895
00:40:49,732 --> 00:40:51,564
- Blah! Blah!
- Oh.

896
00:40:54,321 --> 00:40:55,346
Sorry, Mommy.

897
00:40:55,381 --> 00:40:56,616
Didn't mean to hurt you.

898
00:40:56,694 --> 00:40:59,095
You didn't hurt me, baby. I'm fine.

899
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:01,004
It's gonna get better soon.

900
00:41:01,047 --> 00:41:03,637
I hope the guy who hurt
you got in lots of trouble.

901
00:41:03,696 --> 00:41:06,484
You know, I should go see him.

902
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:09,749
So, the Devil did a good deed today.

903
00:41:09,784 --> 00:41:11,250
Oh. Hmm.

904
00:41:11,323 --> 00:41:13,325
There's no need to call it that.

905
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,986
I enjoyed every minute of it.

906
00:41:15,021 --> 00:41:18,289
You know what I mean.

907
00:41:18,553 --> 00:41:19,952
Mm.

908
00:41:20,018 --> 00:41:23,419
You know, I'm so very used to
being in control of everything.

909
00:41:23,698 --> 00:41:26,832
Not knowing what's gonna come next is...

910
00:41:27,027 --> 00:41:28,634
Can be scary.

911
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:31,671
No. No, I'm finding it
quite exhilarating, actually.

912
00:41:31,731 --> 00:41:33,239
Hmm.

913
00:41:34,321 --> 00:41:35,974
I think you were right, by the way.

914
00:41:36,009 --> 00:41:37,091
About what?

915
00:41:37,185 --> 00:41:40,746
That it may be a "who" that's changing me.

916
00:41:41,244 --> 00:41:46,312
But now that begs the
question: what do I do with her?

917
00:41:46,347 --> 00:41:48,517
<i>I have to warn you,
he's heavily medicated.</i>

918
00:41:48,612 --> 00:41:51,090
I doubt he'll be able to string
two words together right now,

919
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:53,814
much less have a conversation.

920
00:41:53,885 --> 00:41:56,018
Thanks.

921
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,666
Hey, Jimmy.

922
00:42:01,873 --> 00:42:04,502
So this is where you ended up, huh?

923
00:42:04,537 --> 00:42:08,054
I was so wrapped up in
recovery, I forgot to come visit.

924
00:42:08,089 --> 00:42:10,496
You know, from when you shot me.

925
00:42:14,779 --> 00:42:16,351
I have to ask you something, Jimmy,

926
00:42:16,386 --> 00:42:18,720
about that day.

927
00:42:24,754 --> 00:42:27,040
What happened to you, Jimmy?

928
00:42:27,223 --> 00:42:29,624
What happened with Lucifer?

929
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:33,926
Lucifer?

930
00:42:34,067 --> 00:42:35,151
What happened when you shot at me?

931
00:42:35,186 --> 00:42:37,105
- Is he here?! Tell me he's not here!
- No.

932
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,337
No, Jimmy, he's not here.
He's not here, Jimmy.

933
00:42:39,372 --> 00:42:40,539
I know he's here.

934
00:42:40,575 --> 00:42:43,101
I can't get away. I
can't get away from him!

935
00:42:44,178 --> 00:42:45,911
Jimmy, you're safe here.

936
00:42:48,449 --> 00:42:49,771
You're safe.

937
00:42:49,806 --> 00:42:51,677
No, I'm not safe! None of us are!

938
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:54,390
- He's just a man, Jimmy.
- You don't get it, do you?

939
00:42:54,425 --> 00:42:56,889
He's the Devil! He's the Devil!

940
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:58,290
He's the Devil!

941
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:01,193
He's the Devil! He's the Devil!

942

Previously on Lucifer...

2
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:07,250
So you're the Devil, and
you've left Hell behind

3
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:09,986
to take a vacation in Los Angeles.

4
00:00:10,054 --> 00:00:11,120
How could you possibly help me?

5
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:12,121
I have a certain skill set.

6
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:13,590
I can be very persuasive with people.

7
00:00:13,658 --> 00:00:16,025
I got it, the name, the
whole "Lucifer" thing,

8
00:00:16,093 --> 00:00:17,927
and desire is like your superpower.

9
00:00:17,995 --> 00:00:20,029
How did you survive

10
00:00:20,097 --> 00:00:21,497
getting shot six times?

11
00:00:21,565 --> 00:00:22,685
Is that your normal reaction

12
00:00:22,732 --> 00:00:23,666
to someone saving your life?

13
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:25,100
When I see something I can't explain,

14
00:00:25,168 --> 00:00:26,268
yeah, I look for answers.

15
00:00:26,336 --> 00:00:28,016
Well, I've given you
the answer, Detective.

16
00:00:28,037 --> 00:00:29,471
It's not my fault you won't accept it.

17
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:30,539
What happened with Lucifer?

18
00:00:30,607 --> 00:00:31,707
You don't get it, do you?

19
00:00:31,774 --> 00:00:33,842
He's the Devil! He's the Devil!

20
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,144
Where's your ex, Detective Douche?

21
00:00:36,213 --> 00:00:37,157
Hi, Daddy.

22
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,112
Hi, munchkin.

23
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,414
Wow, shocker, you're late.

24
00:00:39,481 --> 00:00:41,048
Come on, give me a break.

25
00:00:41,116 --> 00:00:42,250
Right, here's the deal.

26
00:00:42,318 --> 00:00:45,587
We can have as much naked
cuddle time as you desire,

27
00:00:45,654 --> 00:00:47,622
but you're gonna have
to listen to me too.

28
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,357
You like to hide insecurity

29
00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:50,458
in humor, don't you?

30
00:00:50,526 --> 00:00:51,966
What do you think I'm insecure about?

31
00:00:51,993 --> 00:00:53,661
That you are changing,

32
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:55,362
that you don't know
what's causing the change.

33
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,331
Or who.

34
00:00:58,128 --> 00:01:01,081
_

35
00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:05,520
_

36
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:08,994
_

37
00:01:27,894 --> 00:01:29,827
Go on.

38
00:01:29,895 --> 00:01:32,364
Go ahead, jump.

39
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,100
You know you want to.

40
00:01:36,168 --> 00:01:37,902
Hmm?

41
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,105
Trust me, it's a warm welcome.

42
00:01:41,173 --> 00:01:42,374
Won't it hurt?

43
00:01:42,441 --> 00:01:45,909
Oh, there's only one way to find out.

44
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:55,319
 All day I was out 

45
00:01:55,387 --> 00:01:58,756
 Feeling, thinking of you... 

46
00:01:58,823 --> 00:01:59,823
Lovely.

47
00:01:59,857 --> 00:02:04,894
 Buzzing by myself tonight 

48
00:02:06,664 --> 00:02:07,664
Sorry.

49
00:02:07,731 --> 00:02:09,432
-  Same place 
- Excuse me.

50
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,401
 Same old rhyme 

51
00:02:11,468 --> 00:02:15,638
 Same troubles on my mind, too 

52
00:02:15,706 --> 00:02:17,674
 I still changed and don't know why... 

53
00:02:17,741 --> 00:02:19,061
You're the man of the hour.

54
00:02:19,075 --> 00:02:20,008
Everyone's here to see you.

55
00:02:20,075 --> 00:02:22,311
What's the worst that can happen?

56
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:23,912
Come on, have one drink with me.

57
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:25,947
I can't, I'm sorry, I'm
not trying to be a buzzkill,

58
00:02:26,015 --> 00:02:27,549
I'm just... I'm not in the
mood to party, all right?

59
00:02:27,617 --> 00:02:30,151
How can you decline
this ravishing siren's

60
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:31,953
invitation to imbibe?

61
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:35,424
Well, if L.A.'s taught me anything,

62
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:37,758
constant rejections do build character.

63
00:02:37,826 --> 00:02:39,460
Sincerely doubt "constant rejection"

64
00:02:39,528 --> 00:02:41,061
is something you ever deal with.

65
00:02:42,397 --> 00:02:44,332
You could learn a thing
or two from this guy.

66
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:46,334
Oh.

67
00:02:46,401 --> 00:02:48,068
Witty, charming and wise.

68
00:02:48,136 --> 00:02:49,169
Have you lost your mind?

69
00:02:49,237 --> 00:02:50,938
Do I know you?

70
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:52,172
Lucifer.

71
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,406
Morningstar.

72
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:56,275
Right, you're the club owner guy

73
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:57,510
who grants people favors.

74
00:02:57,578 --> 00:03:00,246
Yeah, I don't need anything from you.

75
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:02,349
Oh, I beg to differ, Ty.

76
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,750
I have been looking for you all night.

77
00:03:03,818 --> 00:03:05,752
And you are in desperate
need of my help.

78
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,455
Star quarterback, number-one draft pick,

79
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:11,223
and yet, for some
inexplicable reason, a virgin.

80
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,991
Look, man, I got all the
haters I need online, all right?

81
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:15,427
No, no, no, no, no, I'm not criticizing.

82
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:16,528
I'm fascinated.

83
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:19,130
I mean, do you know how rare you are?

84
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,633
A celebrity virgin in Los Angeles,

85
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,134
and surrounded by temptation.

86
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:25,371
I mean, you, Ty, are like

87
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:27,772
a four-leaf clover and
a unicorn made a baby.

88
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,241
Without, uh, having sex, of course.

89
00:03:31,977 --> 00:03:33,043
Aw, thanks, I appreciate it.

90
00:03:33,111 --> 00:03:34,645
My agent wanted me to throw this party.

91
00:03:34,713 --> 00:03:35,980
Oh.

92
00:03:36,047 --> 00:03:38,516
- Yeah, he wants me to loosen up.
- He's right.

93
00:03:38,584 --> 00:03:40,017
I've met your type before,

94
00:03:40,085 --> 00:03:41,619
so desperate to control their lives,

95
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:42,953
they forget to enjoy it.

96
00:03:43,021 --> 00:03:45,188
So answer me this.

97
00:03:45,256 --> 00:03:48,892
If you were to ever, you know, let go,

98
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,561
what is it you'd really want to do?

99
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:53,497
I, uh...

100
00:03:53,564 --> 00:03:55,432
- Yeah.
- I...

101
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,768
I want to skip my
morning workout sometimes.

102
00:03:57,835 --> 00:04:00,003
- Boring.
- Just chill on the couch

103
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,070
and watch Master Chef.

104
00:04:01,105 --> 00:04:02,505
This is the fantasy life

105
00:04:02,572 --> 00:04:03,773
of a postmenopausal housewife.

106
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,275
Come on, Ty, there must
be something deeper.

107
00:04:06,342 --> 00:04:07,777
I, um...

108
00:04:07,844 --> 00:04:09,645
Yeah.

109
00:04:09,713 --> 00:04:11,781
I want to get laid so damn bad.

110
00:04:11,848 --> 00:04:13,682
And there it is.

111
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,185
You got no idea how hard it is
holding out for marriage, man.

112
00:04:17,253 --> 00:04:19,253
Uncomfortably hard, I'm sure.

113
00:04:21,123 --> 00:04:22,791
Look, I was going to with my girl,

114
00:04:22,858 --> 00:04:24,526
but, uh, we broke up.

115
00:04:24,593 --> 00:04:25,593
Oh...

116
00:04:25,594 --> 00:04:26,528
I thought she was gonna be

117
00:04:26,595 --> 00:04:27,829
the mother of my children.

118
00:04:27,897 --> 00:04:29,857
Well, she wants to be the
mother of your children.

119
00:04:29,865 --> 00:04:31,800
Come on, Ty, it's the fourth quarter,

120
00:04:31,867 --> 00:04:33,968
but you can still win this game.

121
00:04:34,036 --> 00:04:36,036
I mean, look at her, death and taxes

122
00:04:36,103 --> 00:04:37,438
are less of a sure thing.

123
00:04:37,505 --> 00:04:38,672
No, I can't.

124
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,940
But you desire her.

125
00:04:40,007 --> 00:04:41,341
Why fight it?

126
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:44,177
Because my mother taught me that...

127
00:04:44,245 --> 00:04:46,413
Oh, no, don't-don't bring her
into this that's disgusting.

128
00:04:46,481 --> 00:04:49,416
Uh... it's about you.

129
00:04:49,484 --> 00:04:50,951
What do you want?

130
00:04:52,253 --> 00:04:53,085
Her.

131
00:04:53,153 --> 00:04:55,421
Well, then "carpe diem," my friend.

132
00:05:02,896 --> 00:05:04,831
Ah, hello again, my little cannonball.

133
00:05:04,898 --> 00:05:06,833
Sorry, I didn't
introduce myself earlier.

134
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,601
Lucifer. Morningstar.

135
00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:09,601
Seriously?

136
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:10,836
Yes, yes.

137
00:05:10,903 --> 00:05:12,971
I'm the Devil, hope
you'll hold it against me.

138
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:16,274
Lucifer Morningstar,
the guy who owns Lux?

139
00:05:16,342 --> 00:05:17,175
That's me.

140
00:05:17,242 --> 00:05:18,443
No, it's not.

141
00:05:18,511 --> 00:05:20,345
I've seen him before.

142
00:05:20,412 --> 00:05:21,580
His beats are sick.

143
00:05:21,647 --> 00:05:23,348
I very much beg your pardon.

144
00:05:23,415 --> 00:05:24,415
Beats?

145
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,617
Yeah.

146
00:05:25,685 --> 00:05:27,451
He performed at a rap battle
last week in the Valley.

147
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:30,955
Every single part of that
sentence horrifies me.

148
00:05:31,022 --> 00:05:32,957
It is so gross

149
00:05:33,024 --> 00:05:35,392
that you're pretending
to be someone you're not.

150
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,362
Even your accent is fake.

151
00:05:41,366 --> 00:05:43,600
Me!

152
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:48,605
 Now I'm feeling like a monster... 

153
00:05:50,407 --> 00:05:52,876
Don't mind if I do.

154
00:05:52,943 --> 00:05:54,878
 Monster, monster 

155
00:05:54,945 --> 00:05:56,880
 Ah, ah-ah... ah, ah-ah 

156
00:05:56,947 --> 00:05:59,983
 Monster, monster 

157
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,984
 Ah, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah 

158
00:06:02,051 --> 00:06:06,788
 Monster, monster. 

159
00:06:06,856 --> 00:06:08,524
Lucifer.

160
00:06:08,591 --> 00:06:09,791
Wake up.

161
00:06:09,859 --> 00:06:11,793
Something really bad happened.

162
00:06:11,861 --> 00:06:12,928
Well, I hope you enjoyed
every minute of it.

163
00:06:12,996 --> 00:06:13,896
No, no, no, you don't understand.

164
00:06:13,963 --> 00:06:15,196
Look, I'm freaking out, okay?

165
00:06:15,264 --> 00:06:17,032
Can you just help me, please?

166
00:06:18,299 --> 00:06:19,366
I need that favor.

167
00:06:19,434 --> 00:06:21,168
Right.

168
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,955
Mommy, did Daddy forget to pick me up?

169
00:06:42,023 --> 00:06:45,659
No, monkey, I'm sure he's
just stuck in traffic.

170
00:06:45,726 --> 00:06:47,694
Are you doing homework?

171
00:06:47,762 --> 00:06:48,929
Um, sort of.

172
00:06:48,996 --> 00:06:50,897
What's the assignment?

173
00:06:52,298 --> 00:06:55,968
Uh, well, I saw Lucifer do
some things I can't explain.

174
00:06:56,036 --> 00:06:57,502
Is Lucifer a magician?

175
00:06:57,571 --> 00:06:59,371
That's sort of what I'm
trying to figure out.

176
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:02,041
When Daddy gets here, maybe he can help.

177
00:07:02,108 --> 00:07:03,141
Mm.

178
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:04,710
Sometimes Daddy helps
me with my homework.

179
00:07:04,778 --> 00:07:07,245
I'm not sure if Daddy has the
answers to these questions.

180
00:07:07,313 --> 00:07:09,480
Why don't you just ask Lucifer?

181
00:07:09,548 --> 00:07:12,817
Because if he's a magician,
then he won't reveal his secrets.

182
00:07:12,885 --> 00:07:15,620
So I have to find out on
my own how Lucifer does...

183
00:07:15,688 --> 00:07:19,057
these things that I can't...

184
00:07:19,124 --> 00:07:21,092
explain.

185
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:23,160
Oh, that can't be him.

186
00:07:24,563 --> 00:07:25,563
Decker.

187
00:07:25,597 --> 00:07:28,765
Lucifer, how did you
even get this number?

188
00:07:31,168 --> 00:07:33,103
Excuse the mess,

189
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:36,106
but it's so good of you
to come, Detective Decker.

190
00:07:36,173 --> 00:07:40,110
Thanks for being super-cryptic
in a really unhelpful way.

191
00:07:40,177 --> 00:07:41,411
What's the emergency?

192
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:44,113
Well, it's-it's better
to show than tell, really.

193
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:53,089
I...

Petechial grows
hemorrhaging in the eyes.

196
00:08:10,947 --> 00:08:12,147
Contusions on the neck.

197
00:08:12,215 --> 00:08:13,414
Signs of strangulation.

198
00:08:13,482 --> 00:08:16,684
And one of the victim's
fake nails was ripped off.

199
00:08:16,752 --> 00:08:17,752
Signs of struggle.

200
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,720
We got a murder on our hands.

201
00:08:19,787 --> 00:08:22,256
Thanks.

202
00:08:23,225 --> 00:08:24,959
So what happened?

203
00:08:25,026 --> 00:08:27,627
Um, well, I woke up
early, 'cause my head hurt.

204
00:08:27,695 --> 00:08:28,695
I, uh...

205
00:08:28,696 --> 00:08:30,430
I had a hangover.

206
00:08:30,498 --> 00:08:32,166
I... I've never drank before, so...

207
00:08:32,234 --> 00:08:34,668
That's on me. Sorry.

208
00:08:34,736 --> 00:08:36,269
Yeah, so I came down to get some water,

209
00:08:36,337 --> 00:08:38,004
and that's-that's when
I saw her in the pool.

210
00:08:38,072 --> 00:08:39,072
Did you know her?

211
00:08:39,106 --> 00:08:40,573
Not before last night.

212
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,308
I talked to her for a little bit.

213
00:08:42,376 --> 00:08:44,310
Her name was, uh...

214
00:08:44,378 --> 00:08:45,678
Ali, maybe?

215
00:08:45,746 --> 00:08:48,748
I don't know. I mean, I'm
having a hard time remembering.

216
00:08:51,252 --> 00:08:52,918
You think she accidentally slipped,

217
00:08:52,986 --> 00:08:54,319
fell in the pool and drowned?

218
00:08:54,387 --> 00:08:55,720
No, I think she was murdered.

219
00:08:55,788 --> 00:08:57,722
Oh, my God, that's... that's terrible.

220
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,725
So why didn't you call
the police right away?

221
00:09:00,793 --> 00:09:02,294
Well, I told Lucifer.

222
00:09:02,362 --> 00:09:03,929
He said... he said that
he would call the police.

223
00:09:03,997 --> 00:09:04,997
And I did.

224
00:09:04,998 --> 00:09:06,831
Detective Decker's a homicide detective.

225
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,000
She's been very helpful

226
00:09:08,067 --> 00:09:11,369
in the other murders
that I've encountered.

227
00:09:11,436 --> 00:09:14,238
I am not your personal police concierge.

228
00:09:14,306 --> 00:09:15,973
You are gonna find out
who did this, aren't you?

229
00:09:17,309 --> 00:09:19,210
Of course I am, because that's my job.

230
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:20,677
- Right.
- Not because you want me to.

231
00:09:20,745 --> 00:09:22,213
Right.

232
00:09:22,281 --> 00:09:23,801
First things last. Do you have any idea

233
00:09:23,815 --> 00:09:25,116
who had contact with her last night?

234
00:09:25,183 --> 00:09:28,851
Um, no, uh, no, but they asked
me to get the... the guest list.

235
00:09:30,221 --> 00:09:32,289
Oh, geez.

236
00:09:32,356 --> 00:09:33,589
250 guests.

237
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:34,791
You know what that means.

238
00:09:34,858 --> 00:09:36,226
Great party.

239
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:40,230
250 suspects.

240
00:09:41,332 --> 00:09:43,299
Oh. Uh, I'd be careful with that thing

241
00:09:43,366 --> 00:09:44,599
in the guest bedroom.

242
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,147
There's a good chance you'll go blind.

243
00:09:46,202 --> 00:09:47,636
Unspeakable acts.

244
00:09:47,703 --> 00:09:49,972
Yes, we got a little carried away.

245
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,341
Stop interfering.

246
00:09:52,409 --> 00:09:53,608
I'm helping.

247
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:54,910
You forget that my expertise

248
00:09:54,978 --> 00:09:56,745
is finding the right
people to punish, Detective.

249
00:09:56,813 --> 00:09:57,546
It's what I do.

250
00:09:57,613 --> 00:09:59,448
Or, uh, did, at least.

251
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:00,982
You want to do something?

252
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,151
Then help account for
everyone who was at the party.

253
00:10:03,218 --> 00:10:04,885
- Oh.
- Coroner puts the time of death

254
00:10:04,954 --> 00:10:06,154
between 1:00 and 3:00 a.m.

255
00:10:06,221 --> 00:10:07,388
Actually, is there someone

256
00:10:07,456 --> 00:10:09,296
who can vouch for your
whereabouts at the time?

257
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,192
Several someones, in fact.

258
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,293
Yes.

259
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,395
Get them to tell you every little detail

260
00:10:14,463 --> 00:10:16,130
just to make sure that I'm not lying.

261
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:19,132
I'll have someone else handle that.

262
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,469
So... a bona fide killer on the
loose that needs to be punished.

263
00:10:22,536 --> 00:10:23,494
Time to punch in.

264
00:10:23,504 --> 00:10:25,305
There she is.

265
00:10:25,373 --> 00:10:27,774
Do you know anyone here?

266
00:10:27,842 --> 00:10:29,576
No. Sorry.

267
00:10:29,643 --> 00:10:31,578
I mean, people just
show up to these things.

268
00:10:31,645 --> 00:10:33,246
Did anyone look suspicious?

269
00:10:33,314 --> 00:10:34,750
Where do we start, Detective?

270
00:10:34,751 --> 00:10:36,648
I mean, look at those big strong hands.

271
00:10:36,716 --> 00:10:38,516
Perfect for squeezing
the life out of someone.

272
00:10:38,518 --> 00:10:41,187
Oh, ginger lad.

273
00:10:41,254 --> 00:10:42,455
Soulless bastards.

274
00:10:42,522 --> 00:10:44,190
Give even me the creeps.

275
00:10:44,257 --> 00:10:45,458
I...

276
00:10:45,525 --> 00:10:47,326
You need to sit with the witnesses.

277
00:10:48,295 --> 00:10:49,462
Haven't I proven myself

278
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:50,809
extremely useful at detectiving?

279
00:10:50,864 --> 00:10:53,999
Actually, no, I don't need
your help color-commentating.

280
00:10:54,066 --> 00:10:55,600
I need facts and hard evidence.

281
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:58,103
So unless you can help
me with either, stay.

282
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:01,072
But I don't want to be stuck
out here with these miscreants.

283
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,673
These are your people.

284
00:11:02,741 --> 00:11:04,923
Detective!

285
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:20,224
Hey.

286
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,558
I heard all hands on deck.

287
00:11:21,626 --> 00:11:23,360
I came as quick as I could.

288
00:11:23,428 --> 00:11:24,895
Yeah, and on time.

289
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,331
Look, Chloe, I'm sorry
about earlier, okay?

290
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,965
I got held up at an arrest in Hollywood.

291
00:11:30,034 --> 00:11:31,100
I couldn't get away.

292
00:11:31,168 --> 00:11:32,168
I get it, Dan.

293
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:33,369
Save the apologies for Trixie.

294
00:11:33,437 --> 00:11:34,703
This is work, and right now,

295
00:11:34,771 --> 00:11:36,639
we have a victim with
no fingerprints on file.

296
00:11:36,706 --> 00:11:39,342
These all the unclaimed
items from the party?

297
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,044
Yeah, I checked everything.

298
00:11:41,111 --> 00:11:43,611
Unfortunately, no I.D.
that matches our victim.

299
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:45,113
So, what are you thinking?

300
00:11:45,181 --> 00:11:48,216
Well, I'm thinking our victim

301
00:11:48,284 --> 00:11:50,419
wore a cute red dress.

302
00:11:50,486 --> 00:11:53,221
There's no way she'd
have that pink clutch.

303
00:11:53,289 --> 00:11:54,523
She was out to have fun,

304
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,125
so that nixes anything
big and bulky, like a tote.

305
00:11:57,193 --> 00:11:59,193
I don't know.

306
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:01,062
I'm looking for something small,

307
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:02,229
a little sexy...

308
00:12:02,297 --> 00:12:04,098
classy.

309
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,667
Something like this.

310
00:12:06,734 --> 00:12:07,935
Wait a minute, I-I thought you said

311
00:12:08,002 --> 00:12:09,303
all this stuff was
searched already for I.D.

312
00:12:09,371 --> 00:12:10,871
I'm not looking for an I.D.

313
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,173
I'm looking for a car.

314
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:18,010
Ali Thornton, 23, from Boise, Idaho.

315
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,399
Her info matches the registration

316
00:12:19,413 --> 00:12:20,680
we found in the glove box.

317
00:12:20,747 --> 00:12:21,747
Hmm.

318
00:12:21,748 --> 00:12:23,550
She was a long way from home.

319
00:12:24,418 --> 00:12:26,619
What were you doing here, Ali?

320
00:12:27,754 --> 00:12:29,255
I'll see what I can find on her.

321
00:12:29,323 --> 00:12:30,423
Detectives,

322
00:12:30,491 --> 00:12:31,971
found something in the master bedroom.

323
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,830
Found this here in the bed.

324
00:12:38,898 --> 00:12:42,434
And it matches the missing
fingernail of the victim.

325
00:12:43,536 --> 00:12:45,003
Isn't this Ty's bedroom?

326
00:12:45,071 --> 00:12:50,441
Yeah, looks like they
did a lot more than talk.

327
00:12:58,984 --> 00:13:00,884
What the hell are you doing?

328
00:13:00,952 --> 00:13:03,488
Well, since you banished
me outside with the lepers,

329
00:13:03,555 --> 00:13:05,623
I decided to make myself useful.

330
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:08,458
You call watching porn
on your phone useful?

331
00:13:08,526 --> 00:13:10,227
This isn't my phone, Detective.

332
00:13:10,294 --> 00:13:12,329
I think it's our recently departed's.

333
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,001
Where did you get this?

334
00:13:18,068 --> 00:13:19,908
Just heard a ringy-ding
and followed the noise.

335
00:13:19,937 --> 00:13:20,807
Now, is delete the little

336
00:13:20,832 --> 00:13:21,562
- rubbish bin?
- No.

337
00:13:21,606 --> 00:13:23,673
You can't delete anything on this phone.

338
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:25,374
But it shows Ty and Ali having sex.

339
00:13:25,442 --> 00:13:26,942
It's very distracting.

340
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,010
Wait.

341
00:13:28,011 --> 00:13:29,211
Ooh, you've reached the money shot?

342
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,514
Are you taping this?

343
00:13:33,283 --> 00:13:35,117
I don't know.

344
00:13:35,185 --> 00:13:37,186
Over there, we had a drink.

345
00:13:37,254 --> 00:13:39,522
And I didn't know the girl that well.

346
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,258
Where are you going?

347
00:13:43,325 --> 00:13:45,860
Detective!

348
00:13:45,927 --> 00:13:47,762
Hey!

349
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:49,181
What's going on?

350
00:13:49,206 --> 00:13:50,557
Detective, you're making a mistake.

351
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:51,799
Stay out of this, Lucifer.

352
00:13:51,867 --> 00:13:53,067
Cuff him.

353
00:13:53,135 --> 00:13:54,235
- Wait, what?
- Ty Huntley,

354
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,260
you're under arrest

355
00:13:55,271 --> 00:13:56,371
for the murder of Ali Thornton.

356
00:13:56,438 --> 00:13:57,905
This is ridiculous. Lucifer,

357
00:13:57,973 --> 00:13:59,906
this is all your fault.
I wish I'd never met you.

358
00:14:15,491 --> 00:14:17,425
Trust me, Detective.

359
00:14:17,493 --> 00:14:18,893
I have been doing this a long time.

360
00:14:18,961 --> 00:14:20,194
I know evil.

361
00:14:20,262 --> 00:14:21,363
You've arrested the wrong man.

362
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,297
The person responsible
is still out there.

363
00:14:23,365 --> 00:14:24,531
How are you so sure?

364
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:26,467
What desire would Ty have to kill a girl

365
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:28,268
giving him a wonderful time?

366
00:14:28,336 --> 00:14:30,270
Ty had a squeaky-clean image.

367
00:14:30,338 --> 00:14:32,439
He sleeps with a girl.

368
00:14:32,507 --> 00:14:34,107
Then he finds out she's taping him.

369
00:14:34,175 --> 00:14:35,776
She's gonna ruin everything.

370
00:14:35,844 --> 00:14:37,277
He gets angry and loses control.

371
00:14:37,345 --> 00:14:38,379
You saw the video.

372
00:14:38,446 --> 00:14:40,046
The only thing that that video proves

373
00:14:40,114 --> 00:14:41,180
is that Ty had sex.

374
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:43,282
He was horny, not murderous.

375
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,590
Then why would he lie about it?

376
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:46,218
Blame the tequila.

377
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:48,454
He had motive and opportunity.

378
00:14:48,522 --> 00:14:50,590
Look, I just want to make sure

379
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:52,291
that you're punishing the right person.

380
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:53,459
I will.

381
00:14:53,527 --> 00:14:54,694
That's what I do.

382
00:14:54,762 --> 00:14:56,596
Lovely, we want the same thing.

383
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:57,729
And there's something else on the phone

384
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:58,730
that you should look into...

385
00:14:58,798 --> 00:14:59,898
No more porn. I'm good.

386
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:01,366
No, it's not that. We
should look into it...

387
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:02,734
"We," as in the LAPD,

388
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:04,068
will look into it.

389
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:06,872
You can go now.

390
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,222
Line up some shots, Maze.

391
00:15:26,691 --> 00:15:28,926
Oh, hell, I may just take a bottle.

392
00:15:28,993 --> 00:15:30,594
Thank you.

393
00:15:33,431 --> 00:15:34,731
That was the LAPD.

394
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:37,934
Ah, was Detective Decker
calling to apologize?

395
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:40,369
Unless it involves
lingerie, I don't accept.

396
00:15:40,438 --> 00:15:41,838
Financial Investigations Unit.

397
00:15:41,906 --> 00:15:43,072
Hmm?

398
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,775
Apparently, you destroyed
the honeymoon suite

399
00:15:45,843 --> 00:15:48,077
at the Budget Hut in Tarzana last night.

400
00:15:48,145 --> 00:15:50,378
I'd rather return to the fires of Hell

401
00:15:50,447 --> 00:15:52,080
than spend a night in Tarzana.

402
00:15:52,148 --> 00:15:54,282
And then, someone with
your name and credit card

403
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:57,252
skipped out on a $2,000 tab

404
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,087
at Zany Wings.

405
00:15:59,155 --> 00:16:02,958
Do I look like I'd eat a Zany Wing?

406
00:16:03,025 --> 00:16:04,292
Someone is

407
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,226
clearly masquerading as me!

408
00:16:06,294 --> 00:16:07,528
Rap battles and hot wings?

409
00:16:07,596 --> 00:16:09,530
You need to find this cheap knockoff

410
00:16:09,598 --> 00:16:11,298
and make him suffer...
do you understand?

411
00:16:11,366 --> 00:16:13,267
Why? You said it yourself...

412
00:16:13,335 --> 00:16:15,269
humans are fascinating, right?

413
00:16:16,472 --> 00:16:19,807
I can't wait to see
what this one does next.

414
00:16:21,777 --> 00:16:23,710
Zany Wings.

415
00:16:23,778 --> 00:16:27,180
 You got me dead to rights. 

416
00:16:27,247 --> 00:16:28,515
It's not right!

417
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:31,585
I mean, Budget Huts and Zany Wings?!

418
00:16:31,652 --> 00:16:33,252
I mean, this malfeasant reprobate

419
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,121
is diluting the Lucifer brand!

420
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:38,224
Finally, I get my father's
beef with graven images.

421
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:41,694
Sounds like this guy's
really gotten under your skin.

422
00:16:41,761 --> 00:16:44,062
Typical in a town full of charlatans.

423
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,197
Eh, this is a place

424
00:16:45,264 --> 00:16:47,500
built on lies where nothing is authentic

425
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:48,801
or genuine.

426
00:16:48,869 --> 00:16:50,669
You don't even have to be famous

427
00:16:50,737 --> 00:16:52,771
to get a star on the
Hollywood Walk of Fame?

428
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:54,707
You can just buy one!

429
00:16:54,774 --> 00:16:56,574
Are we still talking about the impostor?

430
00:16:56,642 --> 00:17:00,044
Yes. I'm gonna tear him limb from limb.

431
00:17:00,112 --> 00:17:02,146
Uh... is it possible

432
00:17:02,214 --> 00:17:03,748
you might be overreacting a bit?

433
00:17:03,816 --> 00:17:07,485
No! How would you feel if
some off-the-rack impostor

434
00:17:07,553 --> 00:17:10,087
was dragging your name
through the trenches of Encino?

435
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:13,491
Well, someone stole my
identity a few years back.

436
00:17:13,558 --> 00:17:15,458
And after a few long calls

437
00:17:15,527 --> 00:17:18,862
to the IRS and the bank,
everything was fine.

438
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:20,397
No big deal.

439
00:17:20,464 --> 00:17:21,598
"No big deal."

440
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,500
That's because you're you.

441
00:17:23,568 --> 00:17:25,201
I'm me!

442
00:17:25,269 --> 00:17:26,970
And this is a-a travesty!

443
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:28,739
But your reaction,

444
00:17:28,806 --> 00:17:31,007
your anger toward this

445
00:17:31,074 --> 00:17:33,042
minor inconvenience,

446
00:17:33,109 --> 00:17:35,011
feels a little...

447
00:17:35,078 --> 00:17:36,378
disproportionate to the crime.

448
00:17:36,446 --> 00:17:37,479
Wha...

449
00:17:37,548 --> 00:17:39,114
There might be some displacement.

450
00:17:39,182 --> 00:17:42,031
I'll show you displacement
when I displace his bollocks,

451
00:17:42,032 --> 00:17:44,392
and throw them on the floor
and stamp on them one at a time!

452
00:17:44,454 --> 00:17:46,488
Uh, um...

453
00:17:46,557 --> 00:17:48,023
Why don't you tell me again

454
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,991
about this case you were working on?

455
00:17:51,827 --> 00:17:54,162
Well...

456
00:17:54,229 --> 00:17:55,496
nothing more to say.

457
00:17:55,565 --> 00:17:57,298
A girl was killed

458
00:17:57,366 --> 00:17:59,734
and Detective Decker is
going after the wrong person.

459
00:17:59,802 --> 00:18:02,003
- And that doesn't bother you?
- Well, why should it?

460
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:04,005
Well, because from
everything you've told me,

461
00:18:04,073 --> 00:18:07,407
it sounds like Ty probably had
nothing to do with this murder.

462
00:18:07,475 --> 00:18:09,242
That he got himself into...

463
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:12,145
or someone helped him into...

464
00:18:12,213 --> 00:18:13,547
a bad situation.

465
00:18:13,615 --> 00:18:15,115
And that bothers you.

466
00:18:15,183 --> 00:18:16,383
Yes.

467
00:18:16,451 --> 00:18:17,651
Why?

468
00:18:17,719 --> 00:18:20,554
Because I punish the guilty.

469
00:18:20,622 --> 00:18:23,056
And Ty's not guilty.

470
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:35,201
 Oh, oh, yeah, yeah 

471
00:18:35,268 --> 00:18:36,402
 Oh, oh... 

472
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,804
Detective Chloe Decker, LAPD.

473
00:18:37,871 --> 00:18:40,538
I'm here to see Ty
Huntley's agent, Joe Hanson.

474
00:18:40,607 --> 00:18:41,539
I'm sorry, without an appointment...

475
00:18:42,675 --> 00:18:44,242
Let me get this right... your clients

476
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,111
do all the work, yet you
chaps make all the money?

477
00:18:46,178 --> 00:18:48,413
- Really?
- And they call me the Devil!

478
00:18:49,515 --> 00:18:51,182
If I ever return to Hell,

479
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,218
you kids will be my first call.

480
00:18:53,285 --> 00:18:54,987
Especially you.

481
00:18:55,054 --> 00:18:56,353
Oh, one last thing before I go.

482
00:18:56,421 --> 00:18:58,589
Which of you is into
killing attractive redheads?

483
00:18:58,657 --> 00:19:01,092
Lucifer?

484
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:02,326
Detective!

485
00:19:02,393 --> 00:19:05,295
A word?

486
00:19:05,363 --> 00:19:06,864
Oh?

487
00:19:06,932 --> 00:19:08,565
 ... back to the way I was. 

488
00:19:08,634 --> 00:19:10,334
What the hell do you think you're doing?

489
00:19:10,401 --> 00:19:12,902
Finding, then punishing Ali
Thornton's actual killer.

490
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:14,738
How did you know to come to this agency?

491
00:19:14,805 --> 00:19:16,045
I tried to tell you, Detective.

492
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:17,874
On the dead girl's
phone. She called here...

493
00:19:17,942 --> 00:19:19,575
Here and traded calls with Ty's agency

494
00:19:19,644 --> 00:19:20,877
a few hours before she was killed.

495
00:19:20,945 --> 00:19:22,345
I know, I checked her phone records.

496
00:19:22,346 --> 00:19:23,346
And you're welcome.

497
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:24,614
I also able found out that the call

498
00:19:24,682 --> 00:19:26,182
was transferred to
Ty's agent, Joe Hanson.

499
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,584
Right, so why did the dead
girl even know Ty's agent?

500
00:19:28,653 --> 00:19:30,185
I mean, she was Ty's one night stand.

501
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:31,553
It hardly makes sense.

502
00:19:31,621 --> 00:19:33,022
Well, that's what I'm here to find out.

503
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:34,489
And that's why you can go now.

504
00:19:36,192 --> 00:19:38,060
What's so funny?

505
00:19:38,128 --> 00:19:39,528
Well, the fact that
you think I'm gonna go.

506
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,996
It's hilarious actually.

507
00:19:42,331 --> 00:19:44,166
Lucifer, I don't need your help.

508
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:45,801
Look, I'm not trying
to solve this for you.

509
00:19:45,869 --> 00:19:50,071
I'm ensuring that the right
person is held responsible.

510
00:19:50,139 --> 00:19:53,247
Look, come on, I've been helpful
before, haven't I, Detective?

511
00:19:53,248 --> 00:19:54,976
You step out of line one time...

512
00:19:55,044 --> 00:19:56,678
You can give me a right-good
spanking, I promise.

513
00:19:56,745 --> 00:19:59,147
Come on, let's go.

514
00:19:59,214 --> 00:20:01,348
Ty wouldn't do something like this.

515
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:02,616
He's such a good kid.

516
00:20:02,685 --> 00:20:04,450
I'm actually more curious
about you, Mr. Hanson.

517
00:20:04,518 --> 00:20:05,552
Me?

518
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:07,054
Why? I didn't even go to the party.

519
00:20:07,121 --> 00:20:08,454
I had to work.

520
00:20:08,522 --> 00:20:10,623
You spoke to the victim a few
hours before she was killed.

521
00:20:10,692 --> 00:20:14,427
Maybe it's best if I don't say
anything without my attorney.

522
00:20:14,495 --> 00:20:16,196
Joey! Joe, Joe.

523
00:20:16,263 --> 00:20:17,564
There's no need for that.

524
00:20:17,631 --> 00:20:19,499
Why don't you

525
00:20:19,567 --> 00:20:21,567
tell me what you really want, hmm?

526
00:20:21,634 --> 00:20:25,637
What desires drive a
man such as yourself?

527
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:32,011
I want to be the greatest
agent of all time.

528
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:33,645
Really?

529
00:20:33,714 --> 00:20:34,814
And to do that,

530
00:20:34,881 --> 00:20:38,016
I need to protect my clients.

531
00:20:38,084 --> 00:20:39,818
Come on.

532
00:20:41,453 --> 00:20:42,954
And, uh...

533
00:20:43,022 --> 00:20:45,757
If you want to protect
Ty, tell us what you know.

534
00:20:50,796 --> 00:20:52,997
Let's make a deal.

535
00:20:53,065 --> 00:20:55,933
I'll tell you everything.
You look into something.

536
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Here's a deal.

537
00:20:57,001 --> 00:20:58,301
Tell us everything, and I don't

538
00:20:58,369 --> 00:20:59,703
cuff you in front of your
co-workers and take you in.

539
00:20:59,771 --> 00:21:00,971
I know how this goes.

540
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,240
Ali's a young actress
looking for a break.

541
00:21:03,307 --> 00:21:05,843
An agent promises to
help her out, in exchange,

542
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:08,230
she's treated them like a party
favor to your star clients.

543
00:21:08,246 --> 00:21:09,980
Okay, okay.

544
00:21:10,048 --> 00:21:12,481
I did call Ali.

545
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:14,583
I hired her to have sex with Ty.

546
00:21:14,651 --> 00:21:16,152
Wow, seems I wasn't the only one

547
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,755
who wanted the young
virgin to loosen up.

548
00:21:18,822 --> 00:21:20,656
No, I loved the virgin angle.

549
00:21:20,724 --> 00:21:23,159
It's a clean hook, got
him a lot of attention.

550
00:21:24,294 --> 00:21:27,396
But Ty was a mess.

551
00:21:27,464 --> 00:21:28,764
I needed him

552
00:21:28,831 --> 00:21:31,099
to get over his ex.

553
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:32,234
Why?

554
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,771
Geez.

555
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:38,606
Popular boy, this Ty... isn't he?

556
00:21:38,674 --> 00:21:41,509
So what, did this anger
his ex or something?

557
00:21:41,577 --> 00:21:44,880
No, it's from his ex,

558
00:21:44,947 --> 00:21:46,914
Debra Macall. She left this behind

559
00:21:46,982 --> 00:21:48,548
one of the many times she came here

560
00:21:48,616 --> 00:21:49,984
trying to find him.

561
00:21:50,051 --> 00:21:51,752
She used to call all the time
trying to get a hold of him.

562
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,087
So, he dated a crazy fan?

563
00:21:53,155 --> 00:21:55,189
He didn't know it at the beginning.

564
00:21:55,257 --> 00:21:57,925
So when I figured it out, he
had already fallen for her.

565
00:21:57,993 --> 00:22:00,394
Oh, suppose I can understand why.

566
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:03,529
See, after a while,
Debra got possessive,

567
00:22:03,597 --> 00:22:04,597
controlling...

568
00:22:04,631 --> 00:22:06,199
she thought she was managing him.

569
00:22:06,267 --> 00:22:08,401
So I told Ty he needed
to break up with her.

570
00:22:08,468 --> 00:22:09,936
He refused.

571
00:22:10,004 --> 00:22:12,672
I made Ty file a restraining order

572
00:22:12,739 --> 00:22:14,274
after she broke a girl's nose

573
00:22:14,341 --> 00:22:15,574
just for buying him a mojito.

574
00:22:15,642 --> 00:22:17,243
Quite a hair trigger on this Debra,

575
00:22:17,311 --> 00:22:19,279
- by the sounds of it.
- Hmm.

576
00:22:19,346 --> 00:22:21,613
If Debra found out

577
00:22:21,681 --> 00:22:23,882
that Ty was with that poor girl...

578
00:22:30,756 --> 00:22:33,325
Hmm. Finally, some rain.

579
00:22:33,392 --> 00:22:35,527
Maybe someone up there
is looking out for us.

580
00:22:35,594 --> 00:22:36,828
I can assure you,

581
00:22:36,895 --> 00:22:39,430
He's in no way
meteorologically inclined.

582
00:22:39,497 --> 00:22:40,737
Apart from the whole Noah thing,

583
00:22:40,765 --> 00:22:42,967
and that was a one-off.

584
00:22:47,405 --> 00:22:48,472
Anyhow, her roommate confirmed

585
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,241
that she took the 4:00 p.m. class, so...

586
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:52,609
Ty's ex should be out any second now.

587
00:22:52,677 --> 00:22:54,644
I told you you had the wrong man.

588
00:22:54,712 --> 00:22:56,446
Wrong gender as well, apparently.

589
00:22:56,513 --> 00:22:57,714
Finally, we're getting warmer.

590
00:22:57,781 --> 00:23:00,717
Why are you so hell-bent on
proving Ty's not the killer?

591
00:23:00,784 --> 00:23:01,784
Like I've been saying,

592
00:23:01,785 --> 00:23:03,586
I want to punish the real killer.

593
00:23:03,654 --> 00:23:04,955
But why?

594
00:23:05,022 --> 00:23:06,456
Is it 'cause you pushed him
towards Ali at the party?

595
00:23:06,523 --> 00:23:09,259
Well, I don't see what that
has to do with anything.

596
00:23:09,327 --> 00:23:10,693
And I think you're
starting to agree with me.

597
00:23:10,761 --> 00:23:12,594
Otherwise, you wouldn't
be here, would you?

598
00:23:12,662 --> 00:23:13,863
- Bye!
- Bye!

599
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,898
There she is.

600
00:23:19,069 --> 00:23:20,369
That was great. I'll call you at lunch.

601
00:23:20,436 --> 00:23:22,637
- I'm over here.
- Debra Macall?

602
00:23:22,705 --> 00:23:24,039
I'm Detective Decker, LAPD.

603
00:23:24,107 --> 00:23:26,275
We need to ask you a few
questions about Ty Huntley.

604
00:23:26,343 --> 00:23:27,776
I've got nothing to say.

605
00:23:27,844 --> 00:23:29,404
It's either here or down at the station.

606
00:23:29,444 --> 00:23:31,112
- Leave me alone!
- Debra...

607
00:23:39,021 --> 00:23:40,955
See?

608
00:23:41,023 --> 00:23:42,590
Warmer.

609
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,460
Found this on the undercarriage.

610
00:23:56,515 --> 00:23:57,881
Remote detonator.

611
00:23:57,949 --> 00:24:00,584
Whoever set off this bomb was nearby.

612
00:24:00,651 --> 00:24:02,252
Scour the security cameras in the area.

613
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,223
Get facial I.D.'s on anyone
in a hundred-block radius.

614
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:07,924
You couldn't live with
yourself for committing murder,

615
00:24:07,992 --> 00:24:09,792
so you set your car
to explode, didn't you?

616
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,861
Eh? Wanted to go out
in a blaze of glory.

617
00:24:11,929 --> 00:24:12,762
Of course not!

618
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:15,265
Murder? What are you talking about?

619
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:16,532
Oh, come on...

620
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,880
The bomb was triggered remotely.

621
00:24:17,934 --> 00:24:20,302
Whoever set it off did it
before you got to the car.

622
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:21,604
There's a clear line of sight.

623
00:24:21,671 --> 00:24:23,272
I don't think the plan was to kill you.

624
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,840
I think they wanted to scare you.

625
00:24:24,907 --> 00:24:27,643
So... you know of any reason why
someone would want to do that?

626
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,645
No.

627
00:24:29,712 --> 00:24:31,247
Yes, why did you run, Debra?

628
00:24:31,314 --> 00:24:32,814
Awfully guilty-looking.

629
00:24:33,882 --> 00:24:35,242
I thought you were going to bust me

630
00:24:35,284 --> 00:24:36,644
for violating my restraining order.

631
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,420
I went to Ty's party last night.

632
00:24:40,356 --> 00:24:41,556
I-I just... I just looked.

633
00:24:41,624 --> 00:24:42,990
From outside, through the window.

634
00:24:43,058 --> 00:24:44,058
I couldn't help it, I miss him.

635
00:24:44,126 --> 00:24:46,528
Yes, breaking up's so hard, isn't it?

636
00:24:46,595 --> 00:24:48,329
You're like two pathetic peas in a pod.

637
00:24:48,397 --> 00:24:50,131
Okay, we are made for each other.

638
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:51,632
As good as he is at football,

639
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:53,800
that's how good I am
at being his girlfriend.

640
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:55,302
You mean ex-girlfriend.

641
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,337
We never stay broken
up. It's just a phase.

642
00:24:57,405 --> 00:25:00,073
And no one looks out for
him the way that I do.

643
00:25:00,141 --> 00:25:03,210
And then I saw him
kissing that girl and I...

644
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:04,311
Squeezed the life out of her?

645
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:05,812
No!

646
00:25:06,814 --> 00:25:07,746
Where were you between

647
00:25:07,814 --> 00:25:09,054
1:00 and 3:00 a.m. this morning?

648
00:25:10,651 --> 00:25:13,786
The only place that always
makes me feel better.

649
00:25:18,124 --> 00:25:19,425
How long does this go on?

650
00:25:19,493 --> 00:25:20,793
Three hours.

651
00:25:22,796 --> 00:25:24,356
That's the saddest thing I've ever seen.

652
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:26,798
Yep. All-night froyo shop

653
00:25:26,865 --> 00:25:29,167
puts Debra there well past
the time of the victim's death.

654
00:25:29,235 --> 00:25:30,735
Her alibi checks out.

655
00:25:32,137 --> 00:25:34,072
So Debra didn't strangle Ali.

656
00:25:34,139 --> 00:25:35,873
Well, whoever planted the bomb

657
00:25:35,941 --> 00:25:38,210
went to great lengths to
make us think Debra did it.

658
00:25:38,277 --> 00:25:39,744
Why?

659
00:25:39,812 --> 00:25:40,812
I don't know.

660
00:25:44,316 --> 00:25:48,319
We might actually know
who rigged the car.

661
00:25:50,822 --> 00:25:51,822
Ronnie Hillman.

662
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:55,092
The big Hollywood fixer?

663
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:56,159
Yeah.

664
00:25:56,228 --> 00:25:57,261
A security cam caught her

665
00:25:57,329 --> 00:25:58,969
walking nearby, right
after the explosion.

666
00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:00,149
This can't be a coincidence.

667
00:26:00,197 --> 00:26:01,557
Someone must've hired her for this.

668
00:26:01,565 --> 00:26:03,866
I've been trying to build
a case on her for years,

669
00:26:03,934 --> 00:26:05,335
and every time we've approached her,

670
00:26:05,402 --> 00:26:07,270
she's lawyered up immediately.

671
00:26:07,338 --> 00:26:08,538
Ronnie is a pro.

672
00:26:08,606 --> 00:26:09,805
So how do we approach her?

673
00:26:09,873 --> 00:26:11,107
She's picky about talking to strangers.

674
00:26:11,174 --> 00:26:13,743
Definitely no cops.

675
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,514
What about someone

676
00:26:19,582 --> 00:26:22,117
she'd never expect us to work with?

677
00:26:22,184 --> 00:26:23,918
Do I get a code word?

678
00:26:23,986 --> 00:26:25,987
You know, for when you take her down.

679
00:26:26,055 --> 00:26:27,922
If so, might I suggest

680
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,157
"monkey bottoms"?

681
00:26:29,225 --> 00:26:30,505
'Cause trust me, I can work that

682
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,593
into any sentence quite naturally.

683
00:26:31,661 --> 00:26:33,561
You sure this is a good idea?

684
00:26:33,629 --> 00:26:34,862
Lucifer reached out to her

685
00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:36,964
and she agreed to meet
him, so it's our best shot.

686
00:26:37,031 --> 00:26:39,767
And you won't need a code
word, and you won't be miked,

687
00:26:39,834 --> 00:26:41,302
because she'll be looking for that.

688
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:42,370
This is a simple handoff.

689
00:26:42,404 --> 00:26:44,338
All we need you to do is vouch for Dan

690
00:26:44,406 --> 00:26:45,673
as someone that needs her services.

691
00:26:45,741 --> 00:26:47,475
Vouch for Detective Douche?

692
00:26:47,542 --> 00:26:50,443
Oh, gosh, this is gonna
be harder than I thought.

693
00:26:50,511 --> 00:26:51,911
Once I engage with her, I will hire her

694
00:26:51,979 --> 00:26:52,979
to fix a problem of mine.

695
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,980
Right.

696
00:26:54,014 --> 00:26:55,315
Well, if it's that stick up your ass,

697
00:26:55,383 --> 00:26:57,350
I'm afraid there's no one
strong enough to pull that out.

698
00:26:57,418 --> 00:26:58,718
She goes there to fix my problem,

699
00:26:58,786 --> 00:27:00,453
our people will be
waiting to arrest her.

700
00:27:00,521 --> 00:27:01,655
- Ah.
- And then we'll have leverage

701
00:27:01,722 --> 00:27:03,390
to find out what she
knows about Ali's murder.

702
00:27:03,457 --> 00:27:05,024
She has information we need,

703
00:27:05,092 --> 00:27:06,372
so let's just stick to the plan.

704
00:27:06,426 --> 00:27:08,226
Assuming, of course,
Ronnie hasn't run off

705
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:09,561
because our sting suddenly turned into

706
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:10,962
a Michael BublÐ¹ concert.

707
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:13,599
Lucifer, this isn't a game.

708
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:15,834
- Oh.
- Now, are you up for this or not?

709
00:27:15,902 --> 00:27:19,805
Am I up for encouraging someone
to commit a nefarious act?

710
00:27:19,872 --> 00:27:21,340
Mm, let me think.

711
00:27:21,408 --> 00:27:23,275
Put me in, Coach.

712
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:28,780
 Drown my woes in a lake
of fire, sing a song... 

713
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:30,615
Ooh, lovely moves.

714
00:27:30,683 --> 00:27:32,082
 Drown my woes in a lake of fire 

715
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,751
 Sing a song gonna
take me higher... 

716
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,853
Try to look even more like a douche.

717
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,089
Mission accomplished.

718
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,824
 Lucifer gonna set me free 

719
00:27:40,891 --> 00:27:43,593
 Good Lord turned his back on me 

720
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:46,730
 Lucifer gonna set me free... 

721
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:47,798
She's here.

722
00:27:47,865 --> 00:27:49,599
Okay, great. Here we go.

723
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:56,440
 Never got no good
doing what I'm told 

724
00:27:56,507 --> 00:28:01,009
 It's a mean world
that I've known 

725
00:28:01,077 --> 00:28:02,945
 Now you'll find me where
the devil don't go... 

726
00:28:03,012 --> 00:28:06,215
Ronnie Hillman,
problem-solver extraordinaire.

727
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,721
Oh...

728
00:28:13,056 --> 00:28:14,323
Mm, you checking for a wire

729
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,557
or are you just pleased to see me?

730
00:28:17,393 --> 00:28:18,960
Little bit of both.

731
00:28:19,027 --> 00:28:20,127
Mmm!

732
00:28:20,195 --> 00:28:21,863
Hello, Mr. Morningstar.

733
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:24,332
Rest assured...

734
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,133
I can help you with your problem.

735
00:28:26,201 --> 00:28:28,837
Well, actually, I don't need your help.

736
00:28:28,904 --> 00:28:30,372
I...

737
00:28:30,439 --> 00:28:32,473
Wait, what do you think my problem is?

738
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,375
Impostor running around
ruining your name.

739
00:28:34,442 --> 00:28:37,778
Your professional reputation
has taken a bit of a dive.

740
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,549
As has your sexual one, I'm afraid.

741
00:28:42,617 --> 00:28:44,852
All those unsatisfied ladies...

742
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:46,787
Word gets around.

743
00:28:48,022 --> 00:28:50,790
That is the reason you
reached out to me, isn't it?

744
00:28:55,095 --> 00:28:56,228
Yes.

745
00:28:56,296 --> 00:28:57,530
Yes, it very much is.

746
00:28:57,598 --> 00:28:59,866
I do have a problem
that could use your help.

747
00:28:59,933 --> 00:29:01,133
I am all yours.

748
00:29:01,201 --> 00:29:03,503
Oh! Well, I like you, monkey bottoms.

749
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:05,537
Here's what I need you to do...

750
00:29:05,605 --> 00:29:06,805
 ... doing what I'm told... 

751
00:29:06,873 --> 00:29:09,007
Lucifer, what are you doing?

752
00:29:10,342 --> 00:29:11,777
Hey, Dan, what's going on?

753
00:29:13,446 --> 00:29:15,013
I don't know.

754
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,815
They're still talking.

755
00:29:19,351 --> 00:29:21,820
And now she's leaving.

756
00:29:24,222 --> 00:29:25,823
Lovely.

757
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:28,826
What the hell did you do?

758
00:29:28,894 --> 00:29:31,962
I hired the fixer to fix
a problem, like you wanted.

759
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,531
You let her go. What
happened to the plan?

760
00:29:33,598 --> 00:29:35,666
- I made a better one.
- How?

761
00:29:35,734 --> 00:29:36,934
Just sit tight

762
00:29:37,001 --> 00:29:38,436
and we'll all get what we want.

763
00:29:50,954 --> 00:29:52,854
Finally!

764
00:29:52,922 --> 00:29:55,490
The would-be Prince of Darkness.

765
00:29:55,558 --> 00:29:57,492
Payment due upon delivery.

766
00:29:58,561 --> 00:30:01,129
I'd like to examine the goods first.

767
00:30:01,197 --> 00:30:02,396
Your dime.

768
00:30:06,501 --> 00:30:08,302
Right.

769
00:30:08,369 --> 00:30:10,838
Let's see the face of my impostor.

770
00:30:17,212 --> 00:30:19,245
The resemblance is uncanny.

771
00:30:21,849 --> 00:30:25,485
It most certainly is not.

772
00:30:26,687 --> 00:30:28,554
How could anyone think that you were me?

773
00:30:28,623 --> 00:30:31,290
You know who you're messing with?

774
00:30:31,358 --> 00:30:33,526
I'm Lucifer freaking Morningstar!

775
00:30:33,594 --> 00:30:35,061
Oh...

776
00:30:35,129 --> 00:30:36,228
Are you now?

777
00:30:36,295 --> 00:30:39,164
Well... you've certainly
been a busy bee,

778
00:30:39,232 --> 00:30:41,366
haven't you, "Lucifer"?

779
00:30:41,434 --> 00:30:42,604
Eh?

780
00:30:42,605 --> 00:30:44,670
Apparently, you've
started a modeling agency,

781
00:30:44,738 --> 00:30:47,539
pitched a Web series.

782
00:30:48,775 --> 00:30:49,942
And I hear you've also been

783
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:52,044
very active with the women.

784
00:30:52,112 --> 00:30:53,177
Ladies love me.

785
00:30:53,245 --> 00:30:54,679
What can I say?

786
00:30:54,747 --> 00:30:57,414
It's what they've been
saying that's the trouble.

787
00:30:57,482 --> 00:31:00,317
It seems you're a bit
of a two-pump chump.

788
00:31:00,385 --> 00:31:01,653
Also, a crier afterwards.

789
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,587
That happened one time.

790
00:31:03,656 --> 00:31:06,457
Right. Well, we can't
have you running around

791
00:31:06,525 --> 00:31:08,192
cheapening the Lucifer
brand, now, can we?

792
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,560
What do you say, Maze?

793
00:31:10,628 --> 00:31:12,328
Impalement?

794
00:31:12,396 --> 00:31:13,764
Hmm...

795
00:31:13,831 --> 00:31:16,299
Why rush?

796
00:31:16,367 --> 00:31:18,234
- I say the rack.
- Oh.

797
00:31:18,302 --> 00:31:19,836
- Oh!
- Ooh.

798
00:31:19,904 --> 00:31:21,237
That way,

799
00:31:21,305 --> 00:31:23,040
we can really enjoy it.

800
00:31:23,107 --> 00:31:24,975
Better. Yes, much better.

801
00:31:25,043 --> 00:31:27,209
Every joint of every limb

802
00:31:27,277 --> 00:31:29,011
dislocated before it's torn off.

803
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:32,081
No, no, no, no, no... look,
look, look, I just... I just...

804
00:31:32,149 --> 00:31:34,583
I just wanted to get
chicks and-and free drinks.

805
00:31:34,651 --> 00:31:36,418
Um, really.

806
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,321
My name is Justin.

807
00:31:39,389 --> 00:31:40,389
I'm from Sherman Oaks.

808
00:31:41,591 --> 00:31:43,692
Oh, Justin...

809
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:45,459
the things I'm gonna do to you.

810
00:31:45,527 --> 00:31:46,961
Oh, no, no, no, I-I'm sorry!

811
00:31:47,029 --> 00:31:48,196
I only came here one time

812
00:31:48,263 --> 00:31:50,031
and I just told some girls

813
00:31:50,099 --> 00:31:51,399
that I owned the place, and...

814
00:31:51,466 --> 00:31:53,001
and that opened some doors for me

815
00:31:53,069 --> 00:31:54,268
and so I just started rolling with it.

816
00:31:54,336 --> 00:31:57,072
How dare you abscond my name!

817
00:31:57,139 --> 00:31:58,840
Please, don't hurt me.

818
00:31:58,908 --> 00:32:00,175
Please.

819
00:32:00,242 --> 00:32:01,522
I'm not gonna hurt you,

820
00:32:01,542 --> 00:32:03,844
Justin, I'm going to destroy you.

821
00:32:03,912 --> 00:32:06,146
Oh, this is so hot.

822
00:32:06,214 --> 00:32:09,083
It's like you're punishing yourself.

823
00:32:14,455 --> 00:32:17,591
Seems I could be just, um,

824
00:32:17,658 --> 00:32:19,258
overreacting a bit.

825
00:32:23,663 --> 00:32:25,431
Go.

826
00:32:25,498 --> 00:32:26,665
Go on!

827
00:32:28,468 --> 00:32:30,203
And never sully my name again.

828
00:32:34,174 --> 00:32:35,841
Let's at least take a finger.

829
00:32:35,908 --> 00:32:37,375
We've done enough, Maze.

830
00:32:44,483 --> 00:32:45,951
Pleasure doing business
with you, Lucifer.

831
00:32:46,018 --> 00:32:47,385
Yes, it was, wasn't it?

832
00:32:47,453 --> 00:32:49,955
Which is why I'm going to have
to apologize for my friends.

833
00:32:50,022 --> 00:32:51,123
What friends?

834
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,389
Ronnie Hillman,

835
00:32:52,457 --> 00:32:54,424
you're under arrest for
kidnapping and assault.

836
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,798
Would you mind calling my lawyer?

837
00:33:00,866 --> 00:33:02,986
Her number's in my back pocket.

838
00:33:03,034 --> 00:33:04,501
Yeah, sure thing.

839
00:33:04,569 --> 00:33:06,070
I'll tell her about the kidnapping,

840
00:33:06,138 --> 00:33:07,604
the airtight evidence we have,

841
00:33:07,672 --> 00:33:09,572
the attempted murder on Debra Macall,

842
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,760
and then when we connect
you to Ali Thornton's murder,

843
00:33:11,809 --> 00:33:13,209
maybe you'll get a
nice injection of drugs,

844
00:33:13,277 --> 00:33:15,211
and you can go to sleep forever.

845
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:19,415
Hang on... I had nothing
to do with Ali's murder.

846
00:33:19,483 --> 00:33:23,653
Debra Macall, Ty Huntley's
ex, she's the murderer.

847
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,421
I cared about Ali.

848
00:33:25,489 --> 00:33:26,822
Mm-hmm, here's what I think.

849
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:29,724
I think you tried to scare Debra
into confessing to Ali's murder,

850
00:33:29,793 --> 00:33:31,026
but Debra didn't do it.

851
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:32,795
She's got an ironclad alibi.

852
00:33:35,832 --> 00:33:37,732
This is my fault.

853
00:33:37,801 --> 00:33:39,567
Why?

854
00:33:39,635 --> 00:33:43,271
I promised Ali I would protect her.

855
00:33:43,338 --> 00:33:46,040
All she ever wanted
was to be an actress.

856
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:47,775
She was gonna leave her mark.

857
00:33:47,843 --> 00:33:49,010
But you know how that goes.

858
00:33:49,077 --> 00:33:52,379
Endless rejection, she ran out of money.

859
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:55,349
This was her first gig with me.

860
00:33:55,417 --> 00:33:57,351
She didn't even know if she could do it.

861
00:33:57,419 --> 00:34:01,621
But I told her... I told
her it was just like acting.

862
00:34:01,689 --> 00:34:04,925
Besides, who doesn't want
to sleep with Ty Huntley?

863
00:34:04,992 --> 00:34:07,627
I thought Ty's agent hired
Ali to sleep with him.

864
00:34:07,695 --> 00:34:10,864
He hired me for a number blackmail.

865
00:34:10,932 --> 00:34:14,067
Slip him a roofie, get naked,
whip out a selfie stick,

866
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,335
and voilÐ".

867
00:34:15,402 --> 00:34:17,102
Why would he have any desire

868
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:18,637
to blackmail his own star client,

869
00:34:18,705 --> 00:34:20,239
a client he's all about protecting?

870
00:34:20,307 --> 00:34:23,209
Ty's agent told you
that Debra killed Ali.

871
00:34:23,276 --> 00:34:26,178
He did, yeah.

872
00:34:35,787 --> 00:34:37,255
You think Joe's the killer,

873
00:34:37,323 --> 00:34:40,191
that he took things into his
own hands, quite literally.

874
00:34:40,259 --> 00:34:41,392
We don't have any proof.

875
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:45,029
Right, well, how do you
propose that we get him?

876
00:34:46,065 --> 00:34:47,999
Joe pointed the finger right at Debra,

877
00:34:48,067 --> 00:34:49,267
painted her as crazy.

878
00:34:49,335 --> 00:34:50,801
It's not that hard a picture
to paint, in her case.

879
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:53,403
Why was he so certain
she'd make a good suspect?

880
00:34:53,471 --> 00:34:56,506
Maybe he found out
she went to Ty's party.

881
00:34:56,574 --> 00:34:59,109
Maybe he knew she went to Ty's party.

882
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:18,213
You are looking Basat
the future of football.

883
00:35:18,281 --> 00:35:20,349
The American Dream.

884
00:35:20,417 --> 00:35:24,753
Honest, resilient, heroic.

885
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:27,022
The police tried to pin

886
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:31,093
the death of that poor girl on you.

887
00:35:31,161 --> 00:35:33,928
But we kept it out of the press.

888
00:35:33,995 --> 00:35:37,165
We got you out of jail.

889
00:35:37,232 --> 00:35:39,233
We will always protect you...

890
00:35:39,301 --> 00:35:42,203
and make you a bigger star than ever.

891
00:35:42,271 --> 00:35:45,073
This is Ty Huntley...

892
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,641
rebranded.

893
00:35:53,114 --> 00:35:54,114
Rebranded, eh?

894
00:35:54,182 --> 00:35:55,848
Does it come with a new scent?

895
00:35:55,916 --> 00:35:56,983
Free toy inside?

896
00:35:57,051 --> 00:35:58,918
What do you want?

897
00:35:58,986 --> 00:36:01,321
Ty is free on bail.

898
00:36:01,389 --> 00:36:03,457
We have to talk to Ty
down at the station again,

899
00:36:03,524 --> 00:36:05,258
maybe walk him past a few reporters.

900
00:36:05,326 --> 00:36:06,825
Whoa, hold on, uh, Joe, what is this?

901
00:36:06,893 --> 00:36:08,594
Oh, come on! This is ridiculous.

902
00:36:08,661 --> 00:36:10,829
Ty wouldn't hurt anybody!

903
00:36:10,897 --> 00:36:12,098
What about Debra?

904
00:36:12,165 --> 00:36:13,532
I told you to look into her.

905
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,700
She's the crazy one.

906
00:36:14,767 --> 00:36:16,202
Yes, well, I thought
it was her all along.

907
00:36:16,269 --> 00:36:18,471
I mean, the woman certainly
redefines "intensity."

908
00:36:18,538 --> 00:36:21,340
But Debra was home with a
friend the night of the murder.

909
00:36:21,408 --> 00:36:22,475
What?!

910
00:36:22,542 --> 00:36:23,708
She's lying.

911
00:36:23,775 --> 00:36:25,535
There's no evidence
placing her at the party.

912
00:36:25,544 --> 00:36:26,578
No one saw her.

913
00:36:26,645 --> 00:36:29,046
So are you ready to face the cameras?

914
00:36:29,115 --> 00:36:30,582
His sponsors will love
the free publicity.

915
00:36:30,649 --> 00:36:33,585
Tell me, what's ten percent of nothing?

916
00:36:33,652 --> 00:36:35,320
I saw Debra there.

917
00:36:36,989 --> 00:36:40,190
I went by the party.

918
00:36:40,258 --> 00:36:44,661
But a work call came up,
and I never made it inside.

919
00:36:44,729 --> 00:36:46,296
I didn't say anything before

920
00:36:46,364 --> 00:36:49,133
because I told my wife
I was working late.

921
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,270
When I was driving away, I
saw Debra outside Ty's window.

922
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:55,939
So you admit you were there that night.

923
00:36:56,007 --> 00:36:58,641
Yeah, and so was Debra.

924
00:36:58,708 --> 00:36:59,988
That's the proof you need, right?

925
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,250
That's the proof we need.

926
00:37:01,311 --> 00:37:03,746
We have a sworn statement
from Ronnie Hillman

927
00:37:03,813 --> 00:37:05,014
saying that you hired the victim

928
00:37:05,081 --> 00:37:07,150
to make a sex tape with
Ty to blackmail him.

929
00:37:07,217 --> 00:37:08,651
I just needed to place you at the scene.

930
00:37:08,718 --> 00:37:10,453
Yeah, see, that's why I don't lie.

931
00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:12,522
It's so hard to keep
track of who knows what.

932
00:37:12,589 --> 00:37:14,189
It's not true.

933
00:37:14,257 --> 00:37:16,591
I only want what's best for you, Ty.

934
00:37:16,659 --> 00:37:17,892
You know, I still don't understand.

935
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,594
Why is it my own agent
would want to blackmail me?

936
00:37:19,662 --> 00:37:22,464
Because he thought eventually
you were gonna leave him.

937
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:24,633
What, because I took one
meeting with another agency?

938
00:37:25,734 --> 00:37:26,801
Joe...

939
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:28,370
I only did that to make Debra happy.

940
00:37:28,437 --> 00:37:29,837
But even though you'd broken up,

941
00:37:29,905 --> 00:37:31,145
he knew you'd get back together,

942
00:37:31,173 --> 00:37:33,907
so he decided to strike
first, get some leverage.

943
00:37:33,975 --> 00:37:37,211
If he left me, I would be ruined.

944
00:37:37,279 --> 00:37:38,945
I mean, do you understand?

945
00:37:39,013 --> 00:37:40,381
He is my Brady, my Manning.

946
00:37:40,448 --> 00:37:43,083
But Ali wasn't cut out for
this sort of thing, was she?

947
00:37:43,151 --> 00:37:44,685
She didn't want to give you the video.

948
00:37:44,752 --> 00:37:46,320
Stupid bitch.

949
00:37:48,122 --> 00:37:50,790
She said she realized Ty was a good guy.

950
00:37:50,857 --> 00:37:52,091
She didn't want to go through with it.

951
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:55,495
Her name was Ali Thornton,
and you killed her.

952
00:37:55,563 --> 00:37:56,696
For what?

953
00:37:56,763 --> 00:37:58,831
Greed? Ego?

954
00:37:58,899 --> 00:38:00,099
I didn't want to hurt her.

955
00:38:00,167 --> 00:38:02,702
I just wanted her phone. And...

956
00:38:09,008 --> 00:38:11,210
But I squeezed too hard.

957
00:38:12,778 --> 00:38:13,812
I'm done.

958
00:38:13,879 --> 00:38:16,114
Forget this. I'm out of here.

959
00:38:23,188 --> 00:38:25,022
Did I squeeze too hard?

960
00:38:26,525 --> 00:38:28,726
How did you... ?

961
00:38:28,793 --> 00:38:29,993
What did... ?

962
00:38:30,061 --> 00:38:31,995
Lucifer, what are you doing?

963
00:38:32,063 --> 00:38:34,332
Finally focusing my
anger where it belongs.

964
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:35,433
Lucifer...

965
00:38:42,072 --> 00:38:44,608
Yes, of course.

966
00:38:44,675 --> 00:38:46,175
Your turn, Detective.

967
00:38:55,353 --> 00:38:57,786
I still can't believe Joe did this.

968
00:38:57,854 --> 00:39:01,624
I wasn't ever gonna
leave him, you know that?

969
00:39:01,691 --> 00:39:03,158
Definitely gonna leave him now.

970
00:39:03,226 --> 00:39:04,893
But you know what, you, uh...

971
00:39:04,961 --> 00:39:06,762
you stayed good to your word, Lucifer.

972
00:39:06,829 --> 00:39:07,929
Thank you.

973
00:39:07,997 --> 00:39:11,066
Yes, well, now you owe me one.

974
00:39:13,669 --> 00:39:15,770
Ty!

975
00:39:15,837 --> 00:39:17,538
Ty! Ty!

976
00:39:19,341 --> 00:39:20,341
Oh, my baby.

977
00:39:20,409 --> 00:39:21,942
Oh, my God, I'm so glad to see you.

978
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:24,178
- Oh.
- You are?

979
00:39:24,246 --> 00:39:25,613
Yes, you are crazy, baby.

980
00:39:25,681 --> 00:39:28,048
- But you're my crazy, you hear me?
- Yeah?

981
00:39:29,752 --> 00:39:32,185
Warms the cockles, doesn't it?

982
00:39:33,721 --> 00:39:35,054
So, Detective,

983
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:36,823
looks like you've solved another case

984
00:39:36,891 --> 00:39:37,891
because of me.

985
00:39:37,892 --> 00:39:39,459
I solved this case despite you.

986
00:39:39,527 --> 00:39:41,662
What? What about the cell phone I found?

987
00:39:41,729 --> 00:39:42,929
That was key evidence.

988
00:39:42,997 --> 00:39:44,298
Evidence you almost destroyed.

989
00:39:44,365 --> 00:39:46,866
I got you the leverage
you needed to crack Ronnie.

990
00:39:46,934 --> 00:39:49,302
You co-opted a sting
operation for your own gain.

991
00:39:49,369 --> 00:39:51,737
And I solved another crime.

992
00:39:51,805 --> 00:39:53,906
Identity theft.

993
00:39:53,973 --> 00:39:56,909
Come on, admit it... we
solved this one together.

994
00:39:56,976 --> 00:39:59,712
<i>Or are you too egotistical
to acknowledge my help?</i>

995
00:40:01,481 --> 00:40:04,149
Okay, yeah, you didn't
completely destroy the case.

996
00:40:04,217 --> 00:40:06,618
So you can stop blaming yourself, great.

997
00:40:06,686 --> 00:40:08,119
Whatever do you mean?

998
00:40:09,488 --> 00:40:12,089
The whole reason you tried
to prove Ty's innocence?

999
00:40:12,157 --> 00:40:14,292
Was to catch the true culprit.

1000
00:40:16,061 --> 00:40:17,762
Yeah, sure.

1001
00:40:21,633 --> 00:40:23,967
So I decided not to punish myself.

1002
00:40:24,035 --> 00:40:25,703
Yourself?

1003
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:27,938
Well, my fake self.

1004
00:40:28,005 --> 00:40:29,239
The person I'd kidnapped.

1005
00:40:29,307 --> 00:40:31,508
I decided not to beat him up.

1006
00:40:31,576 --> 00:40:34,010
You were right, I was, um...

1007
00:40:34,078 --> 00:40:35,779
What's the word?

1008
00:40:35,847 --> 00:40:37,314
Displacing?

1009
00:40:37,382 --> 00:40:40,316
Displacing my anger and
frustration on Luci-phony,

1010
00:40:40,384 --> 00:40:43,353
because the right person wasn't
being punished for Ali's death.

1011
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,355
And who was the right person?

1012
00:40:45,422 --> 00:40:48,090
Well, the sleazy agent, of course.

1013
00:40:48,158 --> 00:40:50,360
Ah, yeah.

1014
00:40:50,427 --> 00:40:53,596
Of all the cities in the world, Lucifer,

1015
00:40:53,664 --> 00:40:56,264
why did you decide to
come to Los Angeles?

1016
00:40:56,332 --> 00:40:58,266
Well, the same reason as everyone else.

1017
00:40:58,334 --> 00:41:00,068
Uh, the weather, porn stars,

1018
00:41:00,135 --> 00:41:01,903
Mexican food... mm!

1019
00:41:01,971 --> 00:41:03,304
Mmm.

1020
00:41:03,373 --> 00:41:05,373
You know, you say... you
say people are phony here,

1021
00:41:05,375 --> 00:41:09,310
but I think people come
here to reinvent themselves.

1022
00:41:09,379 --> 00:41:11,312
And I think that's why you're here.

1023
00:41:11,381 --> 00:41:13,313
To reinvent yourself.

1024
00:41:13,382 --> 00:41:16,149
Why would I mess with perfection?

1025
00:41:17,486 --> 00:41:20,287
You like working with
the detective, don't you?

1026
00:41:22,657 --> 00:41:24,592
I told you, I'm good
at punishing people...

1027
00:41:24,659 --> 00:41:27,395
nay, I'm the best at
punishing bad people.

1028
00:41:27,462 --> 00:41:29,863
I didn't enjoy it when
my father forced me to,

1029
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:31,865
but now that it's on my own terms,

1030
00:41:31,932 --> 00:41:33,666
it's downright delightful.

1031
00:41:33,734 --> 00:41:35,869
Yeah, well, I think you don't just enjoy

1032
00:41:35,936 --> 00:41:37,670
punishing the bad guys.

1033
00:41:37,738 --> 00:41:39,873
I think you're starting
to like seeking justice

1034
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:42,141
for the good ones.

1035
00:41:45,312 --> 00:41:46,412
Like Ali.

1036
00:41:49,482 --> 00:41:51,149
It's another reason to hate L.A...

1037
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:52,885
all this self indulgent therapy.

1038
00:41:52,952 --> 00:41:54,052
You should be ashamed.

1039
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,521
You're doing it again.

1040
00:41:55,588 --> 00:41:56,622
What?

1041
00:41:56,689 --> 00:41:58,356
Displacing.

1042
00:41:58,425 --> 00:42:00,158
No, I'm not.

1043
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,760
And that's denial.

1044
00:42:01,828 --> 00:42:03,961
That's a river in Africa.

1045
00:42:15,173 --> 00:42:17,842
 You looked so good at first 

1046
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:21,244
 When I didn't know your name 

1047
00:42:21,312 --> 00:42:24,380
 But you took me by surprise 

1048
00:42:24,449 --> 00:42:28,852
 You made me feel so strange 

1049
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,489
 Ooh... 

1050
00:42:35,927 --> 00:42:39,328
 Ooh...

<i>Previously on</i> Lucifer...

2
00:00:03,371 --> 00:00:05,336
You're the Lord of Hell,
for crying out loud.

3
00:00:05,371 --> 00:00:07,842
I'm retired, Maze. I've
got nothing but time.

4
00:00:07,877 --> 00:00:08,986
How could you possibly help me?

5
00:00:09,021 --> 00:00:12,296
I have the ability to draw
out people's forbidden desires.

6
00:00:12,331 --> 00:00:13,729
I got it. The name,

7
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:14,793
the whole Lucifer thing,

8
00:00:14,828 --> 00:00:16,062
and desire's like your superpower.

9
00:00:16,097 --> 00:00:17,463
It's more like a gift from God, really.

10
00:00:17,498 --> 00:00:19,971
I saw Lucifer do some
things that I can't explain.

11
00:00:20,006 --> 00:00:21,713
Is Lucifer a magician?

12
00:00:21,748 --> 00:00:23,915
That's sort of what I'm
trying to figure out.

13
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:27,335
You were once the brightest
of all of God's angels.

14
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,287
And now, your time here on Earth

15
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:31,788
is affecting you, dear brother.

16
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:32,807
You're changing.

17
00:00:32,842 --> 00:00:34,475
My life is change.

18
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,016
- What are you doing here?
- Ooh, how's your ex? Detective Douche?

19
00:00:38,051 --> 00:00:40,325
You like working with
the detective, don't you?

20
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,236
I told you, I'm good at punishing people.

21
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:44,791
Nay, I'm the best at punishing bad people.

22
00:00:44,826 --> 00:00:48,841
Yeah, well, I think you don't
just enjoy punishing the bad guys.

23
00:00:48,876 --> 00:00:53,498
I think you're starting to like
seeking justice for the good ones.

24
00:01:39,894 --> 00:01:41,270

Lucifer?

27
00:02:29,793 --> 00:02:30,808
Well,

28
00:02:30,843 --> 00:02:33,017
good morning, Detective.

29
00:02:35,435 --> 00:02:37,478
What the hell are you doing here?

30
00:02:37,513 --> 00:02:39,912
- Setting the table.
- You broke into my house?

31
00:02:39,947 --> 00:02:41,531
Yes, well, I hope you don't
mind, but I made a little brekkie.

32
00:02:41,566 --> 00:02:43,576
You were taking forever in the shower.

33
00:02:43,836 --> 00:02:45,451
What do you do in there?

34
00:02:45,486 --> 00:02:46,943
You are unbelievable!

35
00:02:46,978 --> 00:02:50,008
Oh, thank you, but it's you
who should take the compliment.

36
00:02:50,043 --> 00:02:52,509
Really kept things up since <i>Hot
Tub High School,</i> haven't we?

37
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,437
Ding-dong.

38
00:02:53,472 --> 00:02:55,369
I want to shoot you.

39
00:02:55,404 --> 00:02:56,761
Tease. Do it.

40
00:02:56,796 --> 00:02:57,982
I'm immortal, remember?

41
00:02:58,017 --> 00:03:00,062
Uh, do you have any truffle oil?

42
00:03:00,164 --> 00:03:02,354
Lucifer, get out of my house now.

43
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:04,182
- We haven't eaten yet.
- Out.

44
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:05,812
Well, don't we need to
discuss the next case?

45
00:03:05,847 --> 00:03:07,689
There is no next case.

46
00:03:07,724 --> 00:03:08,651
- What?
- Out.

47
00:03:08,686 --> 00:03:10,296
We're already late, so let's go.

48
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:11,268
Lucifer!

49
00:03:11,303 --> 00:03:12,835
Yeah.

50
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,281
What in God's name are you doing here?

51
00:03:14,316 --> 00:03:16,280
Nothing in his name.
Here on my own, actually.

52
00:03:16,316 --> 00:03:18,817
Did you and Mommy have a sleepover?

53
00:03:18,852 --> 00:03:21,784
No. No. Absolutely not, no.

54
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:23,924
What are you guys doing here anyway?

55
00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:25,928
She left her bird report here.

56
00:03:25,963 --> 00:03:27,692
- Want to see?
- Um, not really.

57
00:03:27,727 --> 00:03:29,916
Here, have a snack, child.

58
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:33,816
Are you sleeping with this idiot?

59
00:03:33,917 --> 00:03:36,518
She hasn't had the
pleasure, unfortunately, no.

60
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,328
Okay, everybody out.
Trixie has to get to school.

61
00:03:39,363 --> 00:03:41,669
I got to get to work. Come on, out, please.

62
00:03:41,704 --> 00:03:44,411
No, no, no, no, no, you
can't throw me out again.

63
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,676
Again?

64
00:03:45,796 --> 00:03:47,011
So this is a habit.

65
00:03:47,047 --> 00:03:48,630
- Yes, shocking, isn't it?
- No.

66
00:03:48,665 --> 00:03:50,498
Never been thrown out of
anywhere before in my life.

67
00:03:50,533 --> 00:03:52,250
Well, except for Heaven, of course.

68
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,601
Fine, fine, fine, fine.

69
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:58,055
But somebody please flip the
omelet if it's not already ruined.

70
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,791
Hey, Dan, I'm...

71
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:01,526
Really, Chloe?

72
00:04:02,228 --> 00:04:04,262
I'm disappointed in you.

73
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:23,476
Good. Right, you're here.

74
00:04:23,511 --> 00:04:24,906
- Um, I need to chat.
- Lucifer, we don't have an appointment.

75
00:04:24,941 --> 00:04:26,440
Something very disturbing's just happened.

76
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,006
It's horrific, really.

77
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,568
Uh, for the second time,

78
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,907
I've been thrown out of a woman's house.

79
00:04:31,942 --> 00:04:33,725
- Okay, sorry, uh, Lu...
- I mean, I'm starting to wonder

80
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,946
if the detective has some
sort of biological dysfunction.

81
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:37,565
- Lucifer.
- 'Cause, I mean, I appeal

82
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,941
to the virile urge in all women.

83
00:04:38,976 --> 00:04:41,688
Certainly, well, certainly you
can attest to that, can't you?

84
00:04:41,723 --> 00:04:43,155
Uh, Lucifer, stop.

85
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,744
Yes, of course, sorry. Payment first.

86
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:47,505
Uh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. No! No!

87
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,745
Hmm?

88
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,281
Lucifer, this is George.

89
00:04:53,318 --> 00:04:54,894
George, Lucifer.

90
00:04:55,048 --> 00:04:56,981
Lucifer, George.

91
00:04:59,719 --> 00:05:01,385
Oops.

92
00:05:10,363 --> 00:05:12,630
- Dan, if you're here to scold me...
- No.

93
00:05:12,806 --> 00:05:15,422
I just got off the phone
with the lieutenant.

94
00:05:15,534 --> 00:05:17,134
There's a case.

95
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:19,845
Day four.

96
00:05:19,913 --> 00:05:22,813
Down to three meat sticks,
a half a bottle of water,

97
00:05:22,951 --> 00:05:25,551
217 miles to L.A.

98
00:05:25,641 --> 00:05:27,541
I'm not sure we're gonna make it,

99
00:05:27,647 --> 00:05:31,030
'cause my brother drives
like a narcoleptic old lady.

100
00:05:31,093 --> 00:05:33,117
Say hi, Grandma!

101
00:05:34,662 --> 00:05:36,883
No, that's our only nourishment!

102
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:38,914
Her name's Lindsay Jolson.

103
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,405
Just turned 22.

104
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,818
She went missing catering
a Players' Club event.

105
00:05:42,904 --> 00:05:43,957
Players' Club?

106
00:05:43,992 --> 00:05:45,824
It's one of those skeezy
pickup artist groups.

107
00:05:45,859 --> 00:05:48,166
You know, that teach
geeks how to be sex gods.

108
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:49,095
Got it.

109
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,969
Lindsay was last seen
talking to the lead scumbag.

110
00:05:53,664 --> 00:05:56,073
The founder, Carver Cruz.

111
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,926
So he was interrogated?

112
00:05:57,961 --> 00:06:00,232
Yep, but his lawyer did all the talking.

113
00:06:00,267 --> 00:06:01,752
And with no proof, we're stuck.

114
00:06:01,787 --> 00:06:04,248
But there's a Players'
seminar and after-party today.

115
00:06:04,284 --> 00:06:05,938
And you need to go undercover.

116
00:06:05,973 --> 00:06:07,557
Why me? I'm homicide.

117
00:06:07,592 --> 00:06:08,975
Because you're our best way in.

118
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,196
- I am?
- Apparently these events

119
00:06:10,231 --> 00:06:12,219
are pretty exclusive, and
when I saw the guest list,

120
00:06:12,254 --> 00:06:14,157
I recognized one of the names.

121
00:06:14,298 --> 00:06:17,698
I guess a lot of high-end
club owners are invited.

122
00:06:17,893 --> 00:06:19,426
Oh, come on.

123
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,032
No. You're kidding.

124
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:22,764
I wish I was.

125
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,777
- Lucifer's on the list?
- Yeah.

126
00:06:24,812 --> 00:06:26,608
Yeah, of course he is.

127
00:06:28,258 --> 00:06:30,483
Look...

128
00:06:30,587 --> 00:06:33,669
the last thing I want is the guy I found

129
00:06:33,704 --> 00:06:35,592
making my half-naked wife
breakfast this morning

130
00:06:35,627 --> 00:06:37,082
spending more time with her,

131
00:06:37,117 --> 00:06:38,883
separated or not.

132
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,284
But...

133
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,296
This is the best option.

134
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,113
I wouldn't ask, but I just keep thinking,

135
00:06:45,685 --> 00:06:48,158
what if this was our daughter?

136
00:06:51,274 --> 00:06:54,595
The detective seems
like a very lovely woman.

137
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,351
Well, I suppose, but still, she's human.

138
00:06:56,386 --> 00:06:58,803
Why is she able to refuse my charms?

139
00:06:58,838 --> 00:07:00,543
I mean, is this thing on?

140
00:07:00,578 --> 00:07:03,012
Yes, yes.

141
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:05,855
Definitely on.

142
00:07:08,087 --> 00:07:11,518
It's not that you're afraid that
you don't have power over Chloe.

143
00:07:11,607 --> 00:07:14,187
It's that you're afraid
that she has power over you,

144
00:07:14,222 --> 00:07:15,800
but neither one is true.

145
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,221
- No?
- No.

146
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:20,258
People don't have power over us.

147
00:07:20,293 --> 00:07:22,326
We give it to them.

148
00:07:22,362 --> 00:07:24,723
You have to take your power back.

149
00:07:24,963 --> 00:07:26,046
Right, go on.

150
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:30,670
You say she's nothing special, but
I think you've put her on a pedestal.

151
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:33,004
You need to really get to know her,

152
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,341
warts and all.

153
00:07:35,376 --> 00:07:37,331
I'm sure she has some.

154
00:07:38,807 --> 00:07:42,788
So, demystify her

155
00:07:42,905 --> 00:07:45,766
by bringing her back
down to your own level.

156
00:07:48,278 --> 00:07:49,777
You're right.

157
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,591
It's not her, it's me.

158
00:07:51,653 --> 00:07:53,683
I need to take back control.

159
00:07:53,718 --> 00:07:55,723
I need to behave like I always have.

160
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:57,649
Good. So you understand.

161
00:07:57,713 --> 00:07:58,545
Yes.

162
00:07:58,589 --> 00:07:59,718
Yes.

163
00:07:59,753 --> 00:08:02,520
I mean, it seems obvious now, actually.

164
00:08:02,555 --> 00:08:04,415
I need to have sex with her.

165
00:08:04,477 --> 00:08:07,249
Uh... no, uh, that's not what I said.

166
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:10,847
No, no, no, you're a genius. I mean,
that's the best way to lose interest, right?

167
00:08:10,933 --> 00:08:12,668
Right. Good-o.

168
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,044
Hmm.

169
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,772
Thanks, love.

170
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:16,455
Oh, sure.

171
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,973
- Payment next time, okay?
- Uh...

172
00:08:19,617 --> 00:08:21,250
Um...

173
00:08:28,874 --> 00:08:30,561
Her name's Lindsay Jolson.

174
00:08:30,596 --> 00:08:31,295
Mm-hmm.

175
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,994
She's been missing almost three full days.

176
00:08:34,272 --> 00:08:36,162
Right, so just ask me one more time.

177
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,887
Lucifer, there's a girl missing.

178
00:08:37,922 --> 00:08:39,695
Yes, it's just not every day

179
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:43,282
someone kicks you out of your house,
then three hours later asks you on a date.

180
00:08:43,335 --> 00:08:45,666
It's not a date. It's a work thing.

181
00:08:45,743 --> 00:08:48,235
- Oh.
- And are you gonna help me or not?

182
00:08:48,868 --> 00:08:49,975
All right.

183
00:08:50,116 --> 00:08:53,351
But only 'cause it coincides
perfectly with my own plan.

184
00:08:53,898 --> 00:08:55,019
And what plan is that?

185
00:08:55,054 --> 00:08:57,321
Well, to have sex with you, of course.

186
00:08:57,669 --> 00:08:59,079
Okay.

187
00:08:59,114 --> 00:09:01,766
Wait, you and I... well,
there is no you and I.

188
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:03,473
There's a professional situation,

189
00:09:03,508 --> 00:09:05,496
- and I just need you...
- See, you need me.

190
00:09:05,531 --> 00:09:07,445
The department needs you,
because you're the one...

191
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,799
I'm the one?

192
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,717
On the list for the Player thing.

193
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:13,738
You're quite adorable
when you're flustered.

194
00:09:13,773 --> 00:09:16,368
I... I'm not flustered.

195
00:09:16,403 --> 00:09:17,199
I'm nauseous.

196
00:09:17,281 --> 00:09:19,544
Now you're blushing; I'd
say I'm making headway.

197
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:24,428
Okay, look, let me make
myself perfectly clear.

198
00:09:24,577 --> 00:09:26,217
I will never,

199
00:09:26,252 --> 00:09:29,420
ever, ever sleep with you.

200
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:30,821
Never.

201
00:09:30,857 --> 00:09:32,323
Okay? Got it?

202
00:09:32,358 --> 00:09:34,158
Playing hard to get, I like it.

203
00:09:34,193 --> 00:09:36,727
When Hell freezes over, Lucifer.

204
00:09:36,763 --> 00:09:38,329
I can arrange that, actually.

205
00:09:38,418 --> 00:09:40,368
Get in the car.

206
00:09:43,835 --> 00:09:47,411

207
00:10:00,206 --> 00:10:01,478
Well, hello.

208
00:10:05,349 --> 00:10:07,217
Here you are, Mr. Morningstar.

209
00:10:07,252 --> 00:10:08,787
Well, thank you, lovely.

210
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,112
And here's something else you might need.

211
00:10:13,391 --> 00:10:15,410
Well, yes, that might come in handy.

212
00:10:15,561 --> 00:10:17,261
Pardon the pun.

213
00:10:18,724 --> 00:10:19,729
Whoa.

214
00:10:19,915 --> 00:10:22,802
Did you just number close the nametag girl?

215
00:10:22,837 --> 00:10:24,601
Oh.

216
00:10:25,345 --> 00:10:27,567
Use this wisely. You're welcome.

217
00:10:30,883 --> 00:10:32,529
I can't believe you.

218
00:10:32,596 --> 00:10:35,324
Don't worry, Detective. I'm
more of a leg man myself.

219
00:10:35,406 --> 00:10:37,673
Soon as you say the word,
you'll have your turn.

220
00:10:37,849 --> 00:10:40,882
Wow, you've never been
rejected by a woman, have you?

221
00:10:40,991 --> 00:10:42,187
No.

222
00:10:42,222 --> 00:10:43,861
Get your hands off me!

223
00:10:43,956 --> 00:10:45,479
I want to talk to Carver Cruz!

224
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:47,782
I need you to leave right now, sir.

225
00:10:47,817 --> 00:10:48,950
Carver!

226
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:50,222
Carver, can you hear me?!

227
00:10:50,257 --> 00:10:51,804
It's the missing girl's brother.

228
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,552
What'd you do to my sister?!

229
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:55,461
Get out here, you coward!

230
00:10:55,766 --> 00:10:57,090
It's okay. I got this.

231
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,701
- I know him.
- No, you don't.

232
00:10:58,736 --> 00:11:00,603
Look, I'm sorry. He has
to leave the premises.

233
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:03,473
Oh, I don't think that'll
be necessary, Officer.

234
00:11:03,543 --> 00:11:05,625
Besides, isn't this quite boring?

235
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:10,213
I mean, there are several lovely
ladies milling around out there.

236
00:11:10,315 --> 00:11:12,439
Which one do you desire?

237
00:11:13,928 --> 00:11:15,110
You.

238
00:11:15,316 --> 00:11:16,453
I'm gay.

239
00:11:16,488 --> 00:11:17,514
Oh!

240
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:19,334
Right.

241
00:11:19,442 --> 00:11:21,499
Well, my dance card's full
with this one, I'm afraid.

242
00:11:21,534 --> 00:11:24,096
But the odds are definitely
in your favor out there.

243
00:11:24,131 --> 00:11:27,030
Probably not batting for the
same team, but you never know...

244
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,418
So go on, then. Go forth and conquer.

245
00:11:29,453 --> 00:11:30,842
I know you want to.

246
00:11:30,934 --> 00:11:32,035
Yeah.

247
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:33,870
Right.

248
00:11:34,165 --> 00:11:35,783
Off you pop.

249
00:11:35,818 --> 00:11:37,083
You're Lindsay's brother.

250
00:11:37,118 --> 00:11:37,990
How'd you know that?

251
00:11:38,025 --> 00:11:39,450
Because she's a cop.

252
00:11:39,485 --> 00:11:41,669
Great. Say that louder. I
don't think everyone heard you.

253
00:11:41,704 --> 00:11:42,345
Right.

254
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,615
Sorry, yes, we're here undercover

255
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,017
to find out what happened to your sister.

256
00:11:47,121 --> 00:11:49,752
If you can help me, I'll
tell you what happened.

257
00:11:49,806 --> 00:11:50,920
Carver killed her.

258
00:11:50,956 --> 00:11:52,771
Killed her? You sure about that?

259
00:11:52,806 --> 00:11:54,024
No, but...

260
00:11:54,187 --> 00:11:55,574
look, I know my sister.

261
00:11:55,609 --> 00:11:57,794
She's a good person. She's sweet.

262
00:11:57,829 --> 00:12:01,012
She wouldn't just run off.
She's not even from L.A.

263
00:12:01,331 --> 00:12:03,595
I'm all she has out here.

264
00:12:03,983 --> 00:12:05,481
She's all I have.

265
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,650
Kevin, I promise you,

266
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:09,325
if anyone here hurt your
sister, I'll find them.

267
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,650
And I'll punish them.

268
00:12:10,685 --> 00:12:12,300
Any method you prefer.

269
00:12:12,335 --> 00:12:15,130
Nice solid flogging. Get the ol'
swamp nuts in a vice, you know.

270
00:12:15,165 --> 00:12:16,713
Okay. It's time to go now.

271
00:12:16,748 --> 00:12:19,939
Let us handle this, and if we
hear anything, we'll be in touch.

272
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:21,355
Okay. Thank you.

273
00:12:21,452 --> 00:12:22,269
Yeah.

274
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,873
We've got this.

275
00:12:25,366 --> 00:12:27,162
You have to admit, we're quite a good team.

276
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:31,290
If you weren't so pent-up sexually,
we'd be firing on all cylinders, I'd say.

277
00:12:37,597 --> 00:12:40,391
I'm assuming you learned most of
your moves at events like these.

278
00:12:40,443 --> 00:12:42,291
I've never been to something
like this before in my life.

279
00:12:42,326 --> 00:12:44,591
I certainly don't need any
help getting women into bed.

280
00:12:44,626 --> 00:12:45,625
Till...

281
00:12:45,672 --> 00:12:47,705
Were you hit on the
head when you were small?

282
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,193
No?

283
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:23,103
We are biological machines.

284
00:13:23,184 --> 00:13:26,655
We... are warriors.

285
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:30,654
We... are players!

286
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:38,567
Gentlemen, we are animals.

287
00:13:38,657 --> 00:13:42,892
Men are the wolves, and women...

288
00:13:44,169 --> 00:13:45,969
...are the fluffy bunnies.

289
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:51,107
So we must prepare ourselves for the hunt.

290
00:13:51,143 --> 00:13:51,919
How?

291
00:13:51,954 --> 00:13:53,870
"Follow the list."

292
00:13:53,905 --> 00:13:56,080
Yes! The C.K.C.

293
00:13:56,162 --> 00:13:58,807
The Conduct of Kick-ass Cavemen.

294
00:13:58,885 --> 00:14:01,885
One: Be seen.

295
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:03,197
People pay for this?

296
00:14:03,232 --> 00:14:04,665
Yeah, 5,000 bucks.

297
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,113
Stand out.

298
00:14:06,173 --> 00:14:09,072
The peacock, the lion with his mane.

299
00:14:09,211 --> 00:14:13,113
Two: Be a protector.

300
00:14:13,165 --> 00:14:13,844
Duh.

301
00:14:13,914 --> 00:14:16,995
Women are hardwired to hook up with someone

302
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,722
who can help them survive.

303
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:21,471
It is simple biology, man.

304
00:14:21,506 --> 00:14:24,409
Three: Be brave.

305
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:25,470
Take risks.

306
00:14:25,517 --> 00:14:27,076
Oh, maybe you should take notes.

307
00:14:27,112 --> 00:14:30,493
Four: Be a leader of men.

308
00:14:30,557 --> 00:14:32,831
And the most elusive.

309
00:14:32,895 --> 00:14:37,478
Five: Be confident.

310
00:14:37,619 --> 00:14:39,849
You... are...

311
00:14:39,918 --> 00:14:41,691
a player!

312
00:14:41,726 --> 00:14:42,659
Own it!

313
00:14:43,706 --> 00:14:46,437
Excuse-excuse me! Excuse me, question!

314
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:47,400
What are you doing?

315
00:14:47,435 --> 00:14:48,991
The Q&A's after the speech, buddy.

316
00:14:49,026 --> 00:14:50,667
No, but it's quite pressing.

317
00:14:50,702 --> 00:14:54,852
What if you have all those manly whatnots
and a woman still doesn't respond?

318
00:14:54,887 --> 00:14:58,054
You may think you have them, but you don't.

319
00:14:58,089 --> 00:14:59,594
- Yeah.
- That's why you're here, right?

320
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:01,878
So, gentlemen, you follow these rules,

321
00:15:01,957 --> 00:15:05,574
and you will bed any Betty
you desire, guaranteed.

322
00:15:05,609 --> 00:15:08,818
No. No. No, no, no. I'm certain I've
got everything on your little list,

323
00:15:08,853 --> 00:15:10,587
and more, actually,

324
00:15:10,622 --> 00:15:14,347
yet this woman here won't have sex with me.

325
00:15:16,453 --> 00:15:18,661
Just listen to the speech, buddy.

326
00:15:18,737 --> 00:15:20,180
The system works.

327
00:15:20,244 --> 00:15:21,919
No, but I doubt that.

328
00:15:21,974 --> 00:15:24,411
Because... because if
I can't "bed a Betty,"

329
00:15:24,446 --> 00:15:26,179
then how do you possibly expect

330
00:15:26,214 --> 00:15:29,111
any of these poor miscreants to succeed?

331
00:15:30,228 --> 00:15:33,792
Especially when they're taking
advice from a-a wanker such as you?

332
00:15:33,827 --> 00:15:35,178
All right, just sit down, man.

333
00:15:35,213 --> 00:15:36,538
Yeah, Lucifer, sit down.

334
00:15:36,638 --> 00:15:39,182
I-I just... could we get
the spotlight over here?

335
00:15:39,217 --> 00:15:40,352
Do we have that?

336
00:15:40,387 --> 00:15:42,785
Yeah, yeah. But on-on her.

337
00:15:42,902 --> 00:15:44,425
Good. Right.

338
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,821
Now, you're the expert.

339
00:15:45,892 --> 00:15:47,458
You tell me what's wrong with this picture.

340
00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:49,512
I mean, I'm me.

341
00:15:49,547 --> 00:15:50,154
Right?

342
00:15:50,189 --> 00:15:51,461
And she...

343
00:15:51,496 --> 00:15:53,363
Well, she's a cop, for starters.

344
00:15:54,232 --> 00:15:55,898
She's a cop?

345
00:15:55,934 --> 00:15:58,188
Yes. I mean, talk about the
shallow end of the dating pool.

346
00:15:58,233 --> 00:15:59,623
This is private property.

347
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:02,379
Unless you have a warrant, you
need to leave here immediately.

348
00:16:02,414 --> 00:16:03,473
Security!

349
00:16:03,508 --> 00:16:04,808
Security, her, out.

350
00:16:04,843 --> 00:16:06,736
Okay, we're gonna take a
ten-minute intermission.

351
00:16:06,771 --> 00:16:09,711
- All right? Thank you.
- I haven't finished.

352
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,301
All right.

353
00:16:11,435 --> 00:16:13,435
Oh, it's you again.

354
00:16:15,382 --> 00:16:17,816
Have you two...?

355
00:16:20,174 --> 00:16:22,291
I know. I'm-I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

356
00:16:22,326 --> 00:16:23,934
I... No. No.

357
00:16:23,969 --> 00:16:25,628
I've got it under control.

358
00:16:25,664 --> 00:16:27,166
And Mr. Morningstar, too, yes.

359
00:16:27,201 --> 00:16:28,499
Let me talk to him.

360
00:16:28,534 --> 00:16:29,667
It's a her, and no.

361
00:16:29,702 --> 00:16:31,100
Really? Your boss is a she?

362
00:16:31,161 --> 00:16:32,689
Even better. Give me
the phone, I'll fix it.

363
00:16:32,724 --> 00:16:33,910
No, you can't fix this!

364
00:16:33,945 --> 00:16:35,438
You've already said enough.

365
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:36,220
Sorry!

366
00:16:36,292 --> 00:16:38,092
Not you.

367
00:16:38,221 --> 00:16:41,048
Yes, I-I'll figure out
a way into the party.

368
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,157
It's not a problem.

369
00:16:42,192 --> 00:16:44,883
And-and again, I...

370
00:16:45,117 --> 00:16:48,615
So we're going to the Player after-party.

371
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:49,690
Not you. I am.

372
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:52,169
Well, I'm not sure how that's possible,
now that you've blown your cover.

373
00:16:52,204 --> 00:16:53,733
Well, that was 100% your fault.

374
00:16:53,768 --> 00:16:55,191
I beg to differ.

375
00:16:55,226 --> 00:16:57,809
None of that would have happened if
you'd just complied with my request.

376
00:16:57,844 --> 00:17:00,822
Do you honestly think you can just ask
people to have sex with you and they will?

377
00:17:00,857 --> 00:17:02,532
Well, I usually don't
have to ask, actually.

378
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:04,304
But trust me, it'd be a win-win.

379
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:05,460
And probably another win after that.

380
00:17:05,495 --> 00:17:07,672
I mean, I have tremendous stamina.

381
00:17:07,707 --> 00:17:09,489
There's a girl missing, Lucifer.

382
00:17:09,524 --> 00:17:11,324
She's probably in some hellhole somewhere,

383
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,484
scared out of her mind,
if she's even still alive.

384
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:16,266
And I found out the party
is a cash-only event.

385
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:17,605
That's a first for Carver.

386
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,967
So our only suspect's probably
about to run off to Mexico,

387
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:23,119
and you're worried about boning me?

388
00:17:23,154 --> 00:17:24,681
You're right. Sorry.

389
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,955
- Let's find the girl. Okay?
- Yes.

390
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,695
Sex later.

391
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,992
Kidding.

392
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:29,992
Sort of.

393
00:17:30,722 --> 00:17:32,295
So where's the party?

394
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,486
Cold Bar.

395
00:17:33,521 --> 00:17:34,597
Really?

396
00:17:34,632 --> 00:17:37,033
Well, that place is
notoriously overpriced to rent.

397
00:17:37,068 --> 00:17:39,768
If Carver wants cash, he
shouldn't have it there.

398
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,430
No, he shouldn't.

399
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:48,004
I think I just figured
out how you can fix this.

400
00:17:48,044 --> 00:17:49,103
Oh?

401
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,883
Do tell.

402
00:18:10,829 --> 00:18:12,565
Miss me?

403
00:18:20,271 --> 00:18:23,643
I know why you're here. I
won't help you, Amenadiel.

404
00:18:23,715 --> 00:18:25,205
One way or another, Maze,

405
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,135
I am gonna change your mind, so...

406
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:31,259
You're gonna help me
get Lucifer back to Hell.

407
00:18:31,368 --> 00:18:33,752
Don't make it painful.

408
00:18:34,955 --> 00:18:36,847
You forget.

409
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:38,089
I love pain.

410
00:18:45,098 --> 00:18:46,626
I'm an angel.

411
00:18:46,697 --> 00:18:49,063
You can't beat me, little demon.

412
00:18:51,151 --> 00:18:53,489
Stop and hear me out.

413
00:18:57,044 --> 00:18:58,777
Men...

414
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,146
...they always want to talk.

415
00:19:17,664 --> 00:19:19,270
Enough!

416
00:19:19,348 --> 00:19:21,915
We want the same thing!

417
00:19:22,068 --> 00:19:24,068
Oh, do we?

418
00:19:24,104 --> 00:19:25,737
Let's see.

419
00:19:30,938 --> 00:19:32,872
Uh-oh.

420
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,105
Did I hit a nerve?

421
00:19:38,452 --> 00:19:40,618
Mazikeen, we both know

422
00:19:40,654 --> 00:19:44,051
that something has
fundamentally changed in Lucifer.

423
00:19:44,086 --> 00:19:45,690
Now, aren't you even
the least bit concerned?

424
00:19:45,771 --> 00:19:46,875
No.

425
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,869
It's a phase. It'll pass.

426
00:19:48,904 --> 00:19:50,395
You're lying to me.

427
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:53,064
You're lying to yourself.

428
00:19:55,584 --> 00:19:57,150
Now, we can help each other.

429
00:19:57,185 --> 00:19:59,408
We can get him back to where he belongs,

430
00:19:59,443 --> 00:20:03,112
if you could just provide
me with a weak spot.

431
00:20:03,443 --> 00:20:05,081
Some insight.

432
00:20:05,253 --> 00:20:06,824
No...

433
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:09,006
means no.

434
00:20:27,784 --> 00:20:30,351
Uh... hello?

435
00:20:30,504 --> 00:20:32,120
Uh, Lucifer?

436
00:20:32,213 --> 00:20:34,832
Be out in a moment. Just getting ready.

437
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:36,268
Okay.

438
00:20:36,347 --> 00:20:38,280
Uh, did you do what I told you to do

439
00:20:38,315 --> 00:20:40,332
and call Carver about the Player's Club?

440
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,572
Make yourself a drink, Detective.

441
00:20:42,695 --> 00:20:45,824
No. No. No more drinks.

442
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:47,346
No more blurred lines.

443
00:20:47,381 --> 00:20:51,116
No more breaking into my house
or trying to sleep with me.

444
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:54,032
Look, this is a professional relationship.

445
00:20:54,138 --> 00:20:57,031
I'm a police officer, and you...

446
00:21:03,467 --> 00:21:05,335
...are naked. Oh...

447
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:09,138
Speaking of my surprise visit yesterday,
I decided turnabout's fair play.

448
00:21:09,173 --> 00:21:12,049
You know, tit for tat sort of thing.

449
00:21:12,084 --> 00:21:14,445
This is beyond inappropriate.

450
00:21:14,512 --> 00:21:15,947
And brave, wouldn't you say?

451
00:21:15,982 --> 00:21:19,484
Number three on the
C.K.C. list: take risks.

452
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,654
Okay. Just...

453
00:21:28,689 --> 00:21:31,103
Lucifer, put some freakin' clothes on.

454
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:33,182
All right.

455
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:36,245
But seriously, darling, are you well?

456
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,781
The berries are ripe and
ready to be harvested.

457
00:21:39,867 --> 00:21:42,137
I mean, look at me.

458
00:21:42,172 --> 00:21:43,838
Huh?

459
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,868
Now, you can't argue with that, can you?

460
00:21:57,319 --> 00:22:00,258
What happened to...

461
00:22:00,387 --> 00:22:01,880
My God.

462
00:22:01,974 --> 00:22:02,827
Oh, oh.

463
00:22:02,862 --> 00:22:04,562
Well, yes, I suppose it is his fault.

464
00:22:04,598 --> 00:22:05,630
Whose fault?

465
00:22:05,665 --> 00:22:06,926
My father.

466
00:22:07,004 --> 00:22:08,366
Your dad did that to you?

467
00:22:08,401 --> 00:22:11,092
No, no, no. That's
where I cut my wings off.

468
00:22:11,127 --> 00:22:12,804
- What?
- Well, I didn't.

469
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:14,361
Maze did. I told her to.

470
00:22:14,396 --> 00:22:15,941
N-No.

471
00:22:15,976 --> 00:22:17,964
Seriously.

472
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,646
What is that?

473
00:22:23,346 --> 00:22:25,513
Don't, please.

474
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,423
Okay.

475
00:22:32,459 --> 00:22:36,227
I should get dressed.
Otherwise, we'll miss the party.

476
00:22:36,262 --> 00:22:38,084
So you did make the call?

477
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:39,540
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

478
00:22:39,575 --> 00:22:40,598
Party's at Lux.

479
00:22:40,633 --> 00:22:43,029
Turns out, the words "open
bar" are indeed effective.

480
00:22:43,064 --> 00:22:45,263
So good on you.

481
00:22:45,298 --> 00:22:46,052
Okay.

482
00:22:46,087 --> 00:22:48,487
Can't go wearing that scruffy little getup.

483
00:22:48,522 --> 00:22:50,722
You'll stick out like a sore cop.

484
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:02,507
Where did you get this dress anyhow?

485
00:23:02,542 --> 00:23:04,922
Oh, it was left behind by
one of my overnight guests.

486
00:23:05,005 --> 00:23:06,624
What was she wearing when she left?

487
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,126
- A smile.
- Mm.

488
00:23:08,161 --> 00:23:11,205
If I get an STD from this
thing, I'm gonna kill you.

489
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,331
Oh, there he is.

490
00:23:13,366 --> 00:23:16,447
Oh, he doesn't look suspicious at all.

491
00:23:16,482 --> 00:23:18,670
Hmm, so what's the plan, Detective?

492
00:23:18,705 --> 00:23:20,487
Avoid him for now.

493
00:23:20,522 --> 00:23:22,913
Mingle, find people who
were at the party last week.

494
00:23:22,948 --> 00:23:25,376
See if anyone saw Carver
with our missing girl.

495
00:23:25,412 --> 00:23:26,598
- Hey.
- Hi.

496
00:23:26,633 --> 00:23:29,166
- Are you from Tennessee?
- No.

497
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:31,115
Because you're the only ten I see.

498
00:23:31,151 --> 00:23:33,799
Oh, you poor soul. Does that actually work?

499
00:23:33,877 --> 00:23:35,653
- No.
- No, I didn't think so.

500
00:23:35,689 --> 00:23:36,960
It's cute.

501
00:23:36,995 --> 00:23:38,189
It-it is?

502
00:23:38,224 --> 00:23:39,478
Yeah.

503
00:23:39,513 --> 00:23:41,426
Y-You're cute.

504
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:42,627
You're really cute.

505
00:23:42,662 --> 00:23:45,329
Hey, were you at that party last week?

506
00:23:45,365 --> 00:23:46,980
Uh, no, actually, this is my first.

507
00:23:47,015 --> 00:23:48,800
Okay.

508
00:23:49,591 --> 00:23:51,258
I love this song!

509
00:23:51,293 --> 00:23:52,370
Okay.

510
00:23:52,405 --> 00:23:54,516
Hey, oh, were you at the party last week?

511
00:23:54,551 --> 00:23:57,769
Uh, I think the dress may
have backfired, actually.

512
00:23:59,045 --> 00:24:01,659
I think we've been spotted.

513
00:24:02,818 --> 00:24:05,164
Clearly a man with nothing to hide.

514
00:24:06,186 --> 00:24:07,818
Move!

515
00:24:07,853 --> 00:24:09,420
Get out of the way!

516
00:24:09,456 --> 00:24:10,888
Just...

517
00:24:10,924 --> 00:24:11,989
get out.

518
00:24:12,025 --> 00:24:13,491
Move!

519
00:24:13,526 --> 00:24:15,906
Just come...

520
00:24:16,132 --> 00:24:17,578
Give me the gun, Carver.

521
00:24:17,613 --> 00:24:18,830
Just-just let me go, okay?

522
00:24:18,935 --> 00:24:19,924
I need to go!

523
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:23,387
I'm afraid that's not possible, but
I do have another option for you.

524
00:24:23,422 --> 00:24:24,902
How about a broken back, hmm?

525
00:24:27,874 --> 00:24:29,945
You don't understand, I have to go!

526
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,560
They're gonna kill her now!

527
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,144
You just killed Lindsay!

528
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,985
They? They who?

529
00:24:35,715 --> 00:24:37,790
The people who took her.

530
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,163
- Where is Lindsay?
- I don't know, okay?

531
00:24:49,198 --> 00:24:51,974
I swear to you, somebody kidnapped her.

532
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:54,098
If that's the case, then why
wouldn't you go to the cops?

533
00:24:54,133 --> 00:24:56,572
Because they said they'd kill her if I did.

534
00:24:56,608 --> 00:24:57,640
Maybe they already have.

535
00:24:57,675 --> 00:24:58,856
Excuse me, dear, I don't know why we bother

536
00:24:58,891 --> 00:25:01,332
with all these pithy
little police questions.

537
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:02,945
Tell me...

538
00:25:04,047 --> 00:25:05,798
...what game's the player playing, eh?

539
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,826
What are you after?

540
00:25:10,101 --> 00:25:12,229
I just want Lindsay back.

541
00:25:12,397 --> 00:25:15,146
I swear, I would never hurt her.

542
00:25:15,974 --> 00:25:18,261
I love her.

543
00:25:19,148 --> 00:25:21,605
But she's a fluffy bunny.

544
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,384
You're a wolf.

545
00:25:22,419 --> 00:25:24,862
You-You've built an empire on
the objectification of women.

546
00:25:24,897 --> 00:25:26,892
Yeah, I know. I'm a complete hypocrite.

547
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:30,092
But I-I would give
anything to get her back.

548
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:31,652
You humans.

549
00:25:31,687 --> 00:25:34,204
You never cease to amaze.

550
00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:36,986
Okay, Carver,

551
00:25:37,021 --> 00:25:38,214
say what you're saying is true.

552
00:25:38,249 --> 00:25:39,916
How long have you and
Lindsay been together?

553
00:25:39,951 --> 00:25:41,284
Four months.

554
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:42,874
Next Tuesday.

555
00:25:42,952 --> 00:25:44,625
I tried to keep it quiet,

556
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:48,303
'cause, you know, I'm
the man and everything.

557
00:25:48,412 --> 00:25:49,678
I guess it got out.

558
00:25:49,713 --> 00:25:53,335
So you're saying you slept with
Lindsay on multiple occasions,

559
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:54,931
but you still want to be with her?

560
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,592
Yes, and for the rest of my life.

561
00:25:57,627 --> 00:25:58,448
Well, after four months,

562
00:25:58,483 --> 00:26:01,593
you haven't got her, you
know, out of your system?

563
00:26:01,628 --> 00:26:03,125
How's that possible?

564
00:26:03,345 --> 00:26:04,711
Okay.

565
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:08,044
You have no idea where
they're holding Lindsay?

566
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:12,009
No. But they did send this to me...

567
00:26:12,461 --> 00:26:14,128
...after the seminar.

568
00:26:16,928 --> 00:26:19,121
Said no more cops or she's dead.

569
00:26:19,201 --> 00:26:22,391
So the kidnappers were
there yesterday watching you.

570
00:26:22,868 --> 00:26:24,567
I just hope they weren't at the party.

571
00:26:24,629 --> 00:26:25,838
If they hurt her, I...

572
00:26:25,873 --> 00:26:27,568
It's okay.

573
00:26:27,982 --> 00:26:31,267
Is there anyone you suspect
that might do this to you?

574
00:26:31,302 --> 00:26:31,977
Enemies?

575
00:26:32,012 --> 00:26:34,709
Uh, I'm kind of a polarizing guy.

576
00:26:34,841 --> 00:26:36,511
Okay, the hater list is long.

577
00:26:36,546 --> 00:26:39,529
Hello there, this is Lucifer Morningstar.

578
00:26:42,469 --> 00:26:43,583
Who are you talking to?

579
00:26:43,618 --> 00:26:45,485
- Shh.
- Do not shush me.

580
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,624
- Who's on the phone?
- All one word, that's right.

581
00:26:47,659 --> 00:26:50,757
Yes, I'll be speaking on
Carver's behalf from now on.

582
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:53,056
No, I'm not a cop.

583
00:26:53,091 --> 00:26:54,264
I assure you.

584
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:56,259
- Is that the...
- Yes, it's the kidnappers.

585
00:26:56,294 --> 00:26:57,574
What are you doing?

586
00:26:57,609 --> 00:26:59,370
Of course we have the money.

587
00:26:59,405 --> 00:27:01,097
Just give me a time and location.

588
00:27:01,132 --> 00:27:02,591
Give me the phone.

589
00:27:02,626 --> 00:27:04,310
No, I promise you, no police.

590
00:27:04,345 --> 00:27:05,773
All right?

591
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,822
Okay, then.

592
00:27:06,867 --> 00:27:07,993
- See you shortly. Bye-bye.
- Wait, wait.

593
00:27:08,028 --> 00:27:09,538
Wait, we need proof of life.

594
00:27:09,574 --> 00:27:11,173
Oh.

595
00:27:11,209 --> 00:27:12,808
Um, just a minute.

596
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:14,970
How do we know Lindsay's still alive?

597
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,599
No, they've hung up.

598
00:27:17,431 --> 00:27:18,597
What are you doing?

599
00:27:18,649 --> 00:27:20,215
Not to worry. I've handled it.

600
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,465
I'll be making an exchange
on your behalf this evening.

601
00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:24,714
Cash for your lady love, all right?

602
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,191
Really?

603
00:27:26,246 --> 00:27:29,283
Uh, but why would you do that for me?

604
00:27:29,338 --> 00:27:31,898
Well, isn't it obvious?

605
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,053
Number two on your list: be a protector.

606
00:27:34,088 --> 00:27:35,341
Is it working?

607
00:27:35,376 --> 00:27:36,841
You're not doing this alone.

608
00:27:36,876 --> 00:27:37,957
Afraid so.

609
00:27:37,992 --> 00:27:39,235
I promised, no police.

610
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:41,999
A deal's a deal, especially
one with the Devil.

611
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,111
Besides, I'm the only one
not risking his life on this.

612
00:27:45,146 --> 00:27:47,480
Immortal, remember?

613
00:27:52,084 --> 00:27:53,603
Carver,

614
00:27:53,718 --> 00:27:55,418
I'm all right.

615
00:27:56,518 --> 00:27:57,910
I'm a...

616
00:27:57,992 --> 00:28:00,376
I don't know where I am.

617
00:28:00,501 --> 00:28:02,625
Please come get me.

618
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,236
I love you.

619
00:28:04,271 --> 00:28:06,751
Please.

620
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:09,259
I'm coming with you.

621
00:28:09,294 --> 00:28:10,821
No, I can't let you do that.

622
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:12,799
I'm not gonna call this in,
but you have to stay here.

623
00:28:12,834 --> 00:28:15,268
No discussion. I'm coming with you.

624
00:28:15,338 --> 00:28:16,372
Fine.

625
00:28:16,411 --> 00:28:18,674
You'll have to wait in the car.

626
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,660
Ten more minutes.

627
00:28:45,695 --> 00:28:46,969
Patience.

628
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:48,499
Something doesn't feel right.

629
00:28:48,596 --> 00:28:51,326
Well, of course it
doesn't. It's a kidnapping.

630
00:28:52,777 --> 00:28:54,944
Cool ranch puff?

631
00:28:54,979 --> 00:28:55,878
No, thanks.

632
00:28:55,913 --> 00:28:57,806
- No?
- Mm.

633
00:28:57,877 --> 00:28:59,557
It's funny, isn't it? You'd
think the king of hellfire

634
00:28:59,592 --> 00:29:03,619
would be more of a flaming hot
guy, but love these bad boys.

635
00:29:03,654 --> 00:29:07,370
Okay, let's say you really are the Devil.

636
00:29:07,487 --> 00:29:09,511
All-powerful, immortal, blah, blah, blah.

637
00:29:09,586 --> 00:29:11,429
Does that mean you don't feel pain at all?

638
00:29:11,464 --> 00:29:13,369
Hmm. I like this line of questioning.

639
00:29:13,404 --> 00:29:15,431
Does this mean you're
finally coming around?

640
00:29:15,466 --> 00:29:18,067
No. Just answer the question.

641
00:29:18,102 --> 00:29:21,146
Well, I... I do feel something,

642
00:29:21,181 --> 00:29:23,666
but it's not pain so much as, uh,

643
00:29:23,701 --> 00:29:25,565
a pressure, a nuisance, really.

644
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,972
Okay, so what does it
feel like if you get shot?

645
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,177
Ow.

646
00:29:33,234 --> 00:29:34,800
Well, you asked.

647
00:29:34,952 --> 00:29:37,057
But that's it? Like, a
bullet just bounces off you?

648
00:29:37,092 --> 00:29:40,461
Well, there's no wound or
blood, if that's what you mean.

649
00:29:40,496 --> 00:29:42,714
Can verify with something
sharp if you like.

650
00:29:42,749 --> 00:29:45,294
No, it's not necessary.
It's tempting though.

651
00:29:45,329 --> 00:29:46,595
Huh.

652
00:29:46,631 --> 00:29:49,566
So, does this mean that you believe me?

653
00:29:49,683 --> 00:29:52,911
I'm afraid I can't offer anything
obvious like a tail as proof.

654
00:29:52,946 --> 00:29:55,089
- And so no horns.
- No, afraid not.

655
00:29:55,124 --> 00:29:56,906
That's the stuff of movies and TV.

656
00:29:56,941 --> 00:29:57,607
Mm-hmm.

657
00:29:57,642 --> 00:29:59,041
They always get it wrong.

658
00:29:59,076 --> 00:30:00,917
Well, look, I-I have to admit,

659
00:30:00,952 --> 00:30:02,727
I've seen some things I can't explain,

660
00:30:02,762 --> 00:30:05,729
but I don't believe in
all that Bible stuff.

661
00:30:05,795 --> 00:30:07,906
So you're an atheist. How ironic.

662
00:30:07,975 --> 00:30:09,824
No, not exactly.

663
00:30:09,918 --> 00:30:13,722
I do believe there's good
and evil and right and wrong.

664
00:30:13,758 --> 00:30:17,149
But the whole fiery damnation thing, no.

665
00:30:17,214 --> 00:30:18,247
Does it scare you?

666
00:30:18,329 --> 00:30:22,755
No, I mean, how could I be scared
of something that I don't believe in?

667
00:30:25,269 --> 00:30:27,559
Do I scare you?

668
00:30:30,274 --> 00:30:31,674
No.

669
00:30:36,436 --> 00:30:37,716
Is that Carver?

670
00:30:37,779 --> 00:30:39,078
Hmm?

671
00:30:40,334 --> 00:30:42,254
How did he get here?

672
00:30:42,328 --> 00:30:43,325
Oh, he must have followed us.

673
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,396
- Well done, Detective.
- No, he didn't follow us.

674
00:30:45,466 --> 00:30:47,045
He must have gotten the address somehow.

675
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,578
Or someone told him.

676
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:52,013
Either way, he's gonna get
someone killed, probably himself.

677
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:56,114
This love thing makes you
all quite stupid, doesn't it?

678
00:31:10,047 --> 00:31:12,181
Lucifer!

679
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,654
Lucifer!

680
00:31:23,889 --> 00:31:26,905
Sorry, but I gave my word... no police.

681
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,054
Seriously?

682
00:31:28,117 --> 00:31:29,341
Don't worry, Detective.

683
00:31:29,376 --> 00:31:30,899
I'm immortal, remember?

684
00:31:30,986 --> 00:31:33,639
I knew it.

685
00:31:33,733 --> 00:31:35,653
Hey, guys, I'm gonna need
you sooner than I thought.

686
00:31:35,688 --> 00:31:36,897
Is SWAT ready?

687
00:32:03,883 --> 00:32:04,941
Manly as ever.

688
00:32:04,976 --> 00:32:06,237
Why are you here?

689
00:32:06,272 --> 00:32:07,713
We had a perfectly good plan in place.

690
00:32:07,748 --> 00:32:10,219
Well, after you left, the
kidnappers called back.

691
00:32:10,254 --> 00:32:14,216
They said they changed their
minds, and I come or the deal's off.

692
00:32:14,281 --> 00:32:16,748
Oh, that sounds sinister.

693
00:32:17,474 --> 00:32:19,594
Just hand over the cash,

694
00:32:19,707 --> 00:32:21,078
and no one gets hurt.

695
00:32:21,113 --> 00:32:23,046
Yes, right. Got it here.

696
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,474
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait! Where's Lindsay?!

697
00:32:25,547 --> 00:32:26,565
I want to see her.

698
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,136
No. My rules.

699
00:32:29,172 --> 00:32:30,089
Money first.

700
00:32:30,134 --> 00:32:33,008
Now, Mr. Kidnapper, I believe
that's a fair request actually,

701
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:35,813
so just pop her around
and the money's yours.

702
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:42,846
Greedy little jackal, aren't you?

703
00:32:42,924 --> 00:32:43,781
Give it to me!

704
00:32:43,816 --> 00:32:45,840
Most certainly will not.

705
00:32:45,942 --> 00:32:47,653
Hey, f-forget it!

706
00:32:47,749 --> 00:32:50,240
Just-just give it to him!

707
00:32:50,544 --> 00:32:52,450
I just want her back.

708
00:32:52,866 --> 00:32:54,066
Fine.

709
00:32:55,283 --> 00:32:56,597
Now bring us the girl.

710
00:32:56,633 --> 00:32:58,144
I'm sorry.

711
00:32:58,206 --> 00:32:59,285
That's not gonna happen.

712
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:00,496
What?

713
00:33:00,531 --> 00:33:01,569
I will kill you!

714
00:33:01,631 --> 00:33:03,634
Oh, it's gonna happen.

715
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:05,840
A deal's a deal.

716
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:08,209
I am not leaving here without Lindsay.

717
00:33:08,244 --> 00:33:10,431
No way.

718
00:33:12,248 --> 00:33:14,193
Dearie me.

719
00:33:14,239 --> 00:33:16,839
What is it about you and guns, eh?

720
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,658
Carver?

721
00:33:23,693 --> 00:33:25,373
Oh, no.

722
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:32,416
Lindsay?

723
00:33:32,517 --> 00:33:34,402
Wait. <i>Lindsay</i> Lindsay?

724
00:33:34,494 --> 00:33:35,725
Love of your life Lindsay?

725
00:33:35,778 --> 00:33:38,659
Yeah, sorry, but I can't
let you shoot my brother.

726
00:33:38,764 --> 00:33:40,450
What's up, jackass?

727
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:41,781
I don't understand.

728
00:33:41,816 --> 00:33:43,744
Don't you though?

729
00:33:43,834 --> 00:33:47,238
This foul woman and her backwood
brother played the player.

730
00:33:47,273 --> 00:33:49,308
Lindsay kidnapped herself.

731
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,959
Hell truly hath no fury
like a woman scorned.

732
00:33:51,994 --> 00:33:53,348
You did scorn her, didn't you?

733
00:33:53,395 --> 00:33:55,180
No. No.

734
00:33:55,215 --> 00:33:58,441
For the first time in my life, I didn't.

735
00:33:59,156 --> 00:34:01,256
I loved her.

736
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,510
I love you.

737
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,300
Love me?

738
00:34:05,518 --> 00:34:08,130
Are you kidding? You didn't
even remember my name!

739
00:34:08,193 --> 00:34:09,454
What are you talking about?

740
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:12,183
I met you two years ago, Carver.

741
00:34:12,437 --> 00:34:14,196
We slept together.

742
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,836
And then you never called again.

743
00:34:15,871 --> 00:34:18,553
Guess I was research for your stupid book.

744
00:34:18,632 --> 00:34:20,308
No, no, that's not possible.

745
00:34:20,374 --> 00:34:22,194
No, I-I would've remembered.

746
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:23,617
Nope.

747
00:34:23,652 --> 00:34:25,605
I met you at the library.

748
00:34:25,683 --> 00:34:29,128
It's a good place to score desperate babes.

749
00:34:29,231 --> 00:34:31,502
That's in Chapter 11, I believe.

750
00:34:31,556 --> 00:34:32,793
Oh, that's bad.

751
00:34:32,828 --> 00:34:34,762
I was a virgin, Carver.

752
00:34:34,853 --> 00:34:36,170
That's worse.

753
00:34:36,205 --> 00:34:37,575
It was just another night for you,

754
00:34:37,648 --> 00:34:39,946
but it was a big deal for me.

755
00:34:39,981 --> 00:34:43,571
Oh, God, I'm... I am so sorry, Lindsay.

756
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:45,689
I-I'm different now.

757
00:34:45,747 --> 00:34:48,171
No, I don't think so.

758
00:34:48,206 --> 00:34:49,311
But I am.

759
00:34:49,346 --> 00:34:50,510
Okay, may I speak now?

760
00:34:50,545 --> 00:34:52,404
Because I happen to be
an expert on punishment,

761
00:34:52,439 --> 00:34:54,564
and I'm not sure it fits the crime here.

762
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:56,661
I mean, Carver made a mistake...

763
00:34:56,704 --> 00:34:58,453
well, several really...

764
00:34:58,488 --> 00:34:59,965
but...

765
00:35:00,045 --> 00:35:01,415
you're different.

766
00:35:01,491 --> 00:35:02,533
He's changed.

767
00:35:02,613 --> 00:35:05,668
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

768
00:35:06,044 --> 00:35:07,874
Shut up.

769
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:10,223
You shouldn't even be here.

770
00:35:10,313 --> 00:35:11,779
Now you're dead, too.

771
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:12,927
Shoot them, Linds.

772
00:35:13,002 --> 00:35:15,128
Sorry, can't let you do that, darling.

773
00:35:15,195 --> 00:35:16,968
I mean, I'm indestructible,

774
00:35:17,003 --> 00:35:18,203
but he's off limits as well, I'm afraid.

775
00:35:18,269 --> 00:35:20,627
No, she's right. I-I deserve it.

776
00:35:20,733 --> 00:35:22,275
No, you don't.

777
00:35:22,361 --> 00:35:24,316
Chlamydia, the clap,

778
00:35:24,351 --> 00:35:25,730
raging case of crabs...

779
00:35:25,785 --> 00:35:28,489
that's what you deserve, not death.

780
00:35:28,564 --> 00:35:31,116
And you...

781
00:35:31,419 --> 00:35:33,181
...how are you any better?

782
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:36,570
Why do humans think they can
rectify one evil with another?

783
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,733
I mean, it's clearly the first time

784
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:40,448
this reptile has truly loved a woman,

785
00:35:40,528 --> 00:35:41,786
and this is his reward?

786
00:35:41,887 --> 00:35:42,883
Get away from her!

787
00:35:48,193 --> 00:35:49,022
Oh, God.

788
00:35:49,187 --> 00:35:51,501
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

789
00:35:51,697 --> 00:35:53,174
Please don't hurt me.

790
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:56,973
Why does everyone say that
before they're punished?

791
00:35:57,008 --> 00:35:58,651
Don't kill me!

792
00:35:59,465 --> 00:36:00,711
Lucifer.

793
00:36:01,009 --> 00:36:01,929
Don't move.

794
00:36:01,964 --> 00:36:04,271
Detective, you should leave.

795
00:36:06,651 --> 00:36:07,822
Who are you?

796
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:15,024
What are you?

797
00:36:30,914 --> 00:36:32,056
Did you do this?

798
00:36:32,109 --> 00:36:34,252
I've been trying to
tell you, I'm the Devil.

799
00:36:35,817 --> 00:36:37,496
That's... that's not possible.

800
00:36:37,618 --> 00:36:40,056
I assure you, Detective, it is.

801
00:36:40,168 --> 00:36:42,827
I mean, you've said yourself,
there are things you can't explain.

802
00:36:42,955 --> 00:36:45,164
You need more proof? You've
got the gun. Come on, shoot me.

803
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:47,032
No.

804
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:48,467
I can't shoot you.

805
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,436
Sure you can. Go on, give her
a squeeze, we'll be good to go.

806
00:36:51,471 --> 00:36:54,246
- No.
- Just shoot me, Detective!

807
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:56,956
Please! Because maybe
you'll finally realize...

808
00:36:59,484 --> 00:37:01,275
Good for you!

809
00:37:01,808 --> 00:37:03,815
See? Hardly hurts.

810
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:05,564
I can't believe...

811
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,723
Gah. Actually, no, it's
hurting a little bit.

812
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,615
It's... Gah! It's hurting a lot.

813
00:37:09,748 --> 00:37:11,590
Son of a bitch, that really hurts!

814
00:37:14,594 --> 00:37:16,027
I'm bleeding.

815
00:37:16,063 --> 00:37:18,063
- You're bleeding.
- I'm bleeding.

816
00:37:18,098 --> 00:37:20,165
Oh, crap, of course you're bleeding.

817
00:37:21,496 --> 00:37:22,884
God, what have I done?

818
00:37:22,923 --> 00:37:25,315
I don't... I don't bleed. It's...

819
00:37:27,452 --> 00:37:28,573
Lucifer,

820
00:37:28,608 --> 00:37:30,323
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

821
00:37:30,358 --> 00:37:31,713
What does this mean?

822
00:37:31,822 --> 00:37:32,753
Well, it means I shot you.

823
00:37:32,813 --> 00:37:34,624
And I'm an idiot, and I'm sorry.

824
00:37:34,699 --> 00:37:36,547
And I'm in so much trouble.

825
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:39,308
Ah! It really hurts!

826
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,037
What's happening to me?

827
00:38:04,514 --> 00:38:06,544
Well, speak of the devil.

828
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:10,281
Mr. Morningstar here was just telling
me everything you did in there.

829
00:38:10,317 --> 00:38:11,812
Right.

830
00:38:11,847 --> 00:38:12,686
Well, Lieutenant...

831
00:38:12,721 --> 00:38:14,614
I was just telling your
boss if you hadn't acted

832
00:38:14,649 --> 00:38:16,839
in the way that you did, then,

833
00:38:17,042 --> 00:38:18,453
well, all hell would've broke loose.

834
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:20,318
Isn't that right?

835
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:22,728
Right.

836
00:38:22,763 --> 00:38:23,862
Mm.

837
00:38:25,068 --> 00:38:26,598
Absolutely. And, um...

838
00:38:26,633 --> 00:38:29,271
But you caught the bad
guys; that's the main thing.

839
00:38:29,306 --> 00:38:32,515
Again, I'm sorry that you got caught
in the crossfire, Mr. Morningstar.

840
00:38:32,593 --> 00:38:34,749
Oh, it's just a graze. I hardly felt it.

841
00:38:35,575 --> 00:38:38,483
And call me Lucifer.

842
00:38:40,056 --> 00:38:42,201
Lucifer.

843
00:38:46,623 --> 00:38:49,291
Thank you again for all of your help.

844
00:38:49,334 --> 00:38:51,598
You are so welcome.

845
00:38:55,762 --> 00:38:57,896
Bye, now.

846
00:39:02,936 --> 00:39:04,669
I thought you didn't lie.

847
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:06,137
I don't.

848
00:39:07,507 --> 00:39:10,008
But I don't always tell the whole truth.

849
00:39:10,043 --> 00:39:12,406
Thank you.

850
00:39:13,403 --> 00:39:15,914
You're welcome.

851
00:39:16,107 --> 00:39:18,357
Come on, I'll drive you home.

852
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:21,148
I should bloody hope so,
now you've crippled me.

853
00:39:21,677 --> 00:39:22,642
Wuss.

854
00:39:28,538 --> 00:39:29,838
Thanks, Julia.

855
00:39:30,053 --> 00:39:32,153
Have a good night. Drive safe.

856
00:39:39,409 --> 00:39:40,674
Mommy!

857
00:39:40,807 --> 00:39:42,367
Hey!

858
00:39:42,429 --> 00:39:43,779
What are you doing up?

859
00:39:43,865 --> 00:39:45,543
Can't sleep when you're not home.

860
00:39:45,579 --> 00:39:46,845
Come on, I'll tuck you in.

861
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,393
What's that on your shirt?

862
00:39:50,364 --> 00:39:51,676
Oh.

863
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,594
Um, that's, uh... that's
ketchup from lunch.

864
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:57,448
Nuh-uh. That's blood, Mom.

865
00:39:57,518 --> 00:39:59,544
Right. You're right.

866
00:39:59,622 --> 00:40:03,965
Well, um... I may have hit someone...

867
00:40:04,024 --> 00:40:04,810
with a bullet.

868
00:40:04,845 --> 00:40:07,780
You shot someone? Again?

869
00:40:07,897 --> 00:40:08,800
Barely.

870
00:40:08,835 --> 00:40:09,767
Who?

871
00:40:09,803 --> 00:40:10,703
It was Lucifer.

872
00:40:10,738 --> 00:40:12,570
- Is he okay?
- He's fine.

873
00:40:12,606 --> 00:40:13,514
It was nothing.

874
00:40:13,561 --> 00:40:16,350
It was, like, a little graze.

875
00:40:16,442 --> 00:40:18,316
Okay.

876
00:40:20,644 --> 00:40:22,078
What, babe?

877
00:40:22,188 --> 00:40:24,471
Remember last week, I
told you that boy Noah

878
00:40:24,561 --> 00:40:27,022
kept throwing French
fries at me at lunchtime?

879
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:28,839
- Mm-hmm.
- And you said

880
00:40:28,903 --> 00:40:31,570
it actually might mean he likes me?

881
00:40:31,605 --> 00:40:32,334
Yes.

882
00:40:32,387 --> 00:40:35,848
Well, since you <i>shot</i> Lucifer,

883
00:40:35,941 --> 00:40:39,478
it must mean you <i>really</i> like him.

884
00:40:42,598 --> 00:40:45,436
Hmm.

885
00:40:45,531 --> 00:40:47,839
You know, it is bedtime, you little weasel.

886
00:40:47,874 --> 00:40:50,934
You weasel. I'm gonna get you.

887
00:40:51,012 --> 00:40:52,812
Story time! Story time!

888
00:41:02,322 --> 00:41:03,588
I know.

889
00:41:03,623 --> 00:41:04,913
Tough day at the office.

890
00:41:04,948 --> 00:41:05,770
What happened to you?

891
00:41:05,805 --> 00:41:07,666
Oh, you'll never guess.

892
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,293
She shot me.

893
00:41:09,794 --> 00:41:11,043
And I bled.

894
00:41:11,129 --> 00:41:12,143
What?

895
00:41:12,256 --> 00:41:13,109
That's not possible.

896
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:14,574
I know.

897
00:41:14,901 --> 00:41:16,197
What's causing this?

898
00:41:16,275 --> 00:41:17,618
Is there something you're not telling me?

899
00:41:17,653 --> 00:41:19,474
Don't think about it
too much. It's exciting.

900
00:41:19,532 --> 00:41:21,997
No, it's dangerous.

901
00:41:23,109 --> 00:41:26,811
We've had our fun here,
Lucifer, but this can't happen.

902
00:41:28,515 --> 00:41:30,982
Tell me we're going home.

903
00:41:31,017 --> 00:41:34,175
On the contrary, Maze.

904
00:41:34,927 --> 00:41:37,055
The fun's just begun.

<i>Previously on</i> Lucifer...

2
00:00:02,753 --> 00:00:04,506
Make yourself a drink, Detective.

3
00:00:04,541 --> 00:00:05,816
No more drinks.

4
00:00:05,851 --> 00:00:07,252
No more blurred lines.

5
00:00:07,287 --> 00:00:08,925
No more trying to sleep with me.

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,902
And you... are naked.

7
00:00:10,937 --> 00:00:13,105
This is beyond inappropriate.

8
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,531
What do you think I'm insecure about?

9
00:00:14,566 --> 00:00:16,318
That you are changing.

10
00:00:16,352 --> 00:00:19,188
But that you don't know what's
causing the change. Or who.

11
00:00:19,222 --> 00:00:21,850
Something has fundamentally
changed in Lucifer.

12
00:00:21,885 --> 00:00:24,130
We can get him back to where he belongs

13
00:00:24,165 --> 00:00:26,839
if you could just provide
me with a weak spot.

14
00:00:26,874 --> 00:00:28,027
Are you sleeping with this idiot?

15
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:30,153
She hasn't had the
pleasure, unfortunately, no.

16
00:00:30,188 --> 00:00:31,852
- Hey, Dan, I...
- Really, Chloe?

17
00:00:31,887 --> 00:00:33,153
I'm disappointed in you.

18
00:00:33,188 --> 00:00:34,358
How could you possibly help me?

19
00:00:34,393 --> 00:00:37,639
I have the ability to draw
out people's forbidden desires.

20
00:00:37,674 --> 00:00:38,974
And desire is, like, your superpower.

21
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:40,496
It's more like a gift from God, really.

22
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:41,524
What are you?

23
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:43,212
I've been trying to
tell you. I'm the Devil.

24
00:00:43,246 --> 00:00:45,182
Just shoot me, Detective, please.

25
00:00:45,217 --> 00:00:47,583
Because maybe you'll finally realize...

26
00:00:47,617 --> 00:00:49,482
Son of a bitch, that really hurts.

27
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:51,487
<i>She shot me, and I bled.</i>

28
00:00:51,521 --> 00:00:52,375
That's not possible.

29
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,365
Well, don't think about
it too much; it's exciting.

30
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,553
The fun's just begun.

31
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,478
I very much approve of Benny's
avant-garde approach to clothing.

32
00:01:40,513 --> 00:01:42,953
The models don't appear to be wearing any.

33
00:01:42,988 --> 00:01:45,087
The Benny Choi brand isn't about clothes.

34
00:01:45,122 --> 00:01:46,597
It's the shoes.

35
00:01:46,632 --> 00:01:49,240
These guys kill for limited-edition kicks.

36
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,113
Six G's a pair.

37
00:01:51,147 --> 00:01:54,307
Oh, even the Mistress
of Excess is impressed.

38
00:01:54,342 --> 00:01:56,284
Go, Benny.

39
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,586
Oh, hello.

40
00:01:58,627 --> 00:02:01,657
Mmm, dangerous.

41
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:03,136
Lucifer likes.

42
00:02:03,171 --> 00:02:04,980
You were shot and you bled.

43
00:02:05,015 --> 00:02:07,222
No sharp objects until we find out why.

44
00:02:07,257 --> 00:02:08,797
Oh, quite the opposite.

45
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:11,663
The danger of getting
hurt's positively thrilling.

46
00:02:14,563 --> 00:02:16,256
Fun with mortality.

47
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,740
Bring it.

48
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:19,787
Excuse me.

49
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:22,834
Since when does the Devil
care about mortality?

50
00:02:22,869 --> 00:02:24,179
Great show, Benny.

51
00:02:27,075 --> 00:02:29,835
Ladies and gentlemen, Benny Choi!

52
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:39,509
Now, come on, gorgeous, you tell
me your most dangerous desire.

53
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,920
Cheeseburger.

54
00:02:41,955 --> 00:02:43,399
Cheeseburger? Really?

55
00:02:49,907 --> 00:02:51,172
Benny, get down!

56
00:02:51,207 --> 00:02:52,741
What was that?

57
00:02:58,339 --> 00:03:00,610
It's a bit early for last call.

58
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:02,502
Never mind.

59
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:05,832
You need to leave. Now.

60
00:03:05,867 --> 00:03:07,796
What's the rush? It's
just getting exciting.

61
00:03:07,831 --> 00:03:10,359
Humans are playing with their guns,
and now they're running for cover.

62
00:03:10,393 --> 00:03:12,435
No reason to find out if
your bones will break too.

63
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,396
Well, what about my broken... heart?

64
00:03:14,431 --> 00:03:15,731
Move!

65
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:20,033
Get down! Get down!

66
00:03:28,563 --> 00:03:30,580
Move, move! Y'all got to move!

67
00:03:30,615 --> 00:03:32,281
Come on! Let's go!

68
00:03:34,897 --> 00:03:37,191
People really do kill for Benny's shoes.

69
00:03:37,226 --> 00:03:39,232
- We need to get out of here now.
- Why?

70
00:03:39,267 --> 00:03:40,923
I just found my danger.

71
00:03:46,437 --> 00:03:49,976
She snuck out of the house.

72
00:03:50,011 --> 00:03:53,013
I thought she was asleep.

73
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:56,772
Mrs. Cortez, I'll find who
caused your daughter's death.

74
00:03:56,851 --> 00:03:58,619
I promise you.

75
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,249
You okay?

76
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,052
Her only child was trampled to death,

77
00:04:05,087 --> 00:04:06,864
after some thug fired into a crowd.

78
00:04:06,899 --> 00:04:08,099
I've been better.

79
00:04:08,732 --> 00:04:13,361
Gang Unit's piggybacking Homicide till we
can figure out who wanted Benny Choi dead.

80
00:04:13,396 --> 00:04:14,522
Is he talking?

81
00:04:14,557 --> 00:04:17,030
Clammed up as soon as we
got to the crime scene.

82
00:04:17,065 --> 00:04:18,366
Okay.

83
00:04:18,975 --> 00:04:20,396
It could get bloody.

84
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,431
You should probably stay as
safe as possible on this one.

85
00:04:22,465 --> 00:04:25,229
Oh, yeah? Stick to the nice girly murders?

86
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:27,202
It just seems that
every time I turn around,

87
00:04:27,237 --> 00:04:30,917
you're in another shootout with
your buddy Lucifer by your side.

88
00:04:31,567 --> 00:04:32,307
Not an issue.

89
00:04:32,342 --> 00:04:34,684
He was just, I don't know,

90
00:04:34,719 --> 00:04:37,143
uh, some mystery that I wanted solved.

91
00:04:37,178 --> 00:04:38,814
I could think of a few other choice names.

92
00:04:38,848 --> 00:04:40,328
Yeah, how about complete wack job?

93
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:43,476
Don't worry, Lucifer Morningstar
is completely out of my life.

94
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:44,265
Right.

95
00:04:46,162 --> 00:04:47,721
Get this one tighter.

96
00:04:47,756 --> 00:04:48,741
- Tighter?
- Yeah.

97
00:04:48,776 --> 00:04:50,444
Really, Officer?

98
00:04:51,928 --> 00:04:54,036
And he's sitting on my desk.

99
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:55,381
Get out of that one.

100
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,299
Please tell me I'm hallucinating.

101
00:04:57,334 --> 00:04:59,511
Well, I am dreamy, but
try to contain yourself.

102
00:04:59,546 --> 00:05:00,626
What are you doing here?

103
00:05:00,661 --> 00:05:01,746
I'm not actually here to see you.

104
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:04,340
I've come to talk to your boss.

105
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:06,102
About a shooting.

106
00:05:06,137 --> 00:05:07,631
Okay, I thought you had my back on this.

107
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:10,126
If the department finds out what
really happened, I could lose my badge.

108
00:05:10,161 --> 00:05:12,534
What, you mean the fact
that you shot me on purpose?

109
00:05:15,528 --> 00:05:17,989
I told you I was sorry about that.

110
00:05:18,024 --> 00:05:20,156
And I feel badly, I do. But it was a graze.

111
00:05:20,191 --> 00:05:21,746
I doubt it even left a scar.

112
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:24,366
Didn't it?

113
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:26,819
Mr. Morningstar?

114
00:05:26,854 --> 00:05:28,165
- I can see you now.
- Splendid!

115
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,728
Splendid. We've so much to discuss.

116
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,463
Ooh.

117
00:05:38,776 --> 00:05:41,018
So what can I do for you?

118
00:05:41,053 --> 00:05:42,111
Well, Lieutenant,

119
00:05:42,145 --> 00:05:45,692
as you know, I was witness to
that grizzly death at Benny's.

120
00:05:45,727 --> 00:05:46,987
I mean, only a matter of time

121
00:05:47,022 --> 00:05:48,904
before those gentlemen
start pointing fingers

122
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:51,782
and the whole... the whole thing explodes.

123
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:53,467
- And?
- I want in.

124
00:05:53,502 --> 00:05:54,511
- In?
- On the action.

125
00:05:54,546 --> 00:05:56,793
I got a taste of danger, and I want more.

126
00:05:56,828 --> 00:06:00,067
This case is the perfect method
for me to explore my mortality

127
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:02,828
in an exciting and dangerous way.

128
00:06:03,257 --> 00:06:07,936
And... help find out who's responsible
for that poor girl's death, of course.

129
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:10,572
I realize you've been very
helpful to Detective Decker

130
00:06:10,607 --> 00:06:12,657
on her last couple of cases, but...

131
00:06:12,715 --> 00:06:15,904
exploring mortality is
not really what I do here.

132
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:17,227
- No?
- Uh-uh.

133
00:06:17,262 --> 00:06:18,935
It's funny, 'cause you're
an ambitious one, aren't you?

134
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,705
I can tell.

135
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,307
Brimming with desire.

136
00:06:28,837 --> 00:06:30,938
If I'm gonna be the first
female chief of police,

137
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,881
I need a big close.

138
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:35,197
Of course you do. Of course you do.

139
00:06:35,232 --> 00:06:37,434
And how do you plan on
achieving this grand goal?

140
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:41,036
I will never be appointed without the
support of the minority communities.

141
00:06:41,071 --> 00:06:42,563
Right, yes.

142
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:44,230
Well, I tell you what.

143
00:06:44,265 --> 00:06:46,624
If you allow me to assist on this case,

144
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:49,073
and... possibly others,

145
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:53,244
I'll deliver you all
the support you need, eh?

146
00:06:54,451 --> 00:06:56,452
Just consider it a favor.

147
00:06:56,486 --> 00:06:58,554
From a friend.

148
00:06:58,955 --> 00:06:59,812
After you.

149
00:06:59,847 --> 00:07:02,057
Thank you so much.

150
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:03,623
Olivia, I can explain.

151
00:07:03,658 --> 00:07:06,026
Oh, you better explain
why you have been keeping

152
00:07:06,061 --> 00:07:09,798
such a valuable resource all to yourself.

153
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,300
Excuse me?

154
00:07:11,334 --> 00:07:13,447
We have someone who can
make Benny Choi talk.

155
00:07:13,482 --> 00:07:14,670
Someone with charm,

156
00:07:14,704 --> 00:07:17,613
- likability...
- And has real ties to the community.

157
00:07:17,648 --> 00:07:18,236
Here it comes.

158
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,076
Lucifer Morningstar has volunteered

159
00:07:20,111 --> 00:07:23,313
to act as liaison in the Paola Cortez case.

160
00:07:25,176 --> 00:07:27,031
You're welcome, Decker.

161
00:07:29,777 --> 00:07:31,244
Steady on.

162
00:07:35,341 --> 00:07:38,342
That wack job's gonna
totally get me killed.

164
00:07:55,506 --> 00:07:56,634
<i>What could you have possibly said</i>

165
00:07:56,669 --> 00:07:57,980
to con your way onto another case?

166
00:07:58,015 --> 00:08:00,065
Well, I simply offered
the lieutenant a favor.

167
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:01,912
She gets what she wants,
and I get what I want...

168
00:08:01,947 --> 00:08:03,739
a nice juicy gang war.

169
00:08:03,824 --> 00:08:06,210
You mean you offered to help
<i>prevent</i> a gang war, right?

170
00:08:06,245 --> 00:08:07,273
Tomato,
tom-ah-to.

171
00:08:07,308 --> 00:08:09,220
But, see, that's why we
make such great partners.

172
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:10,592
The "he said, she said" of it all.

173
00:08:10,627 --> 00:08:12,417
The yin-yang, the fireworks.

174
00:08:12,452 --> 00:08:13,349
Partners?

175
00:08:13,384 --> 00:08:14,465
More like glorified ride-along.

176
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,215
Just think, you and me,
close proximity at all times.

177
00:08:17,249 --> 00:08:18,657
Yeah, in L.A., we call that "stalking."

178
00:08:18,692 --> 00:08:19,975
It's wonderful, isn't it?

179
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,666
Uh, when do I get my own gun?

180
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,646
I wouldn't trust you
with my kid's lightsaber.

181
00:08:23,681 --> 00:08:24,856
- And when do I get...
- I'll never let you drive.

182
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:27,188
If I'm gonna be forced to work
with you again, I call the shots.

183
00:08:27,223 --> 00:08:28,459
You most certainly do.

184
00:08:28,494 --> 00:08:29,777
Right in the leg.

185
00:08:29,812 --> 00:08:31,749
I only shot you because you told me to.

186
00:08:31,784 --> 00:08:34,893
In a moment of weakness, I
somehow fell for your hocus-pocus

187
00:08:34,928 --> 00:08:37,761
and believed that you
actually might be the Devil.

188
00:08:37,796 --> 00:08:39,424
I <i>am</i> the Devil.

189
00:08:39,459 --> 00:08:41,649
Historically invincible, until now,

190
00:08:41,684 --> 00:08:43,236
and that's what makes
this case so exciting...

191
00:08:43,271 --> 00:08:44,609
real danger.

192
00:08:44,644 --> 00:08:47,890
It's the perfect opportunity to see
what other mortal qualities I have.

193
00:08:50,359 --> 00:08:52,539
Okay, I get it... you
want to feel new things.

194
00:08:52,612 --> 00:08:54,159
Exactly.

195
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:55,930
- How's that?
- Bloody hell!

196
00:08:55,965 --> 00:08:57,055
That hurt!

197
00:08:57,089 --> 00:08:58,185
Do it again.

198
00:09:00,532 --> 00:09:01,926
So where to, eh?

199
00:09:01,961 --> 00:09:03,490
Stakeout, ambush?

200
00:09:03,525 --> 00:09:04,890
You know, I'm quite skilled at restraints.

201
00:09:04,925 --> 00:09:06,197
No, I'm taking you home.

202
00:09:06,257 --> 00:09:07,299
Ooh, how did you know?

203
00:09:07,357 --> 00:09:08,516
That I'd last about ten minutes with you?

204
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:09,654
I don't know, call it a gut feeling.

205
00:09:09,689 --> 00:09:11,004
Well, it's a successful one.

206
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:12,704
We'll be right on time.

207
00:09:12,776 --> 00:09:14,726
Time? For what?

208
00:09:14,798 --> 00:09:16,204
Lucifer, my man!

209
00:09:16,274 --> 00:09:18,373
Benny!

210
00:09:18,408 --> 00:09:19,474
Nice to see you.

211
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,814
So you're friends with Benny
Choi and his blinged-out pet pig.

212
00:09:22,848 --> 00:09:23,835
- Of course you are.
- Mm-hmm.

213
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,472
His name is Pig Diddy.

214
00:09:25,507 --> 00:09:27,728
This is my assistant Hector.

215
00:09:27,763 --> 00:09:28,448
Ooh.

216
00:09:28,483 --> 00:09:30,347
Someone love his mommy?

217
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,473
Ex-Marine, bitch.

218
00:09:32,508 --> 00:09:33,026
Right.

219
00:09:33,061 --> 00:09:36,061
Yes, Benny and I go back to the
start of his very impressive career.

220
00:09:36,095 --> 00:09:38,278
Huh, let me guess, you did him a favor.

221
00:09:38,313 --> 00:09:40,262
Lucifer helped me get my first show.

222
00:09:40,297 --> 00:09:41,792
He was a real inspiration.

223
00:09:41,827 --> 00:09:43,676
I try to reflect that in my art.

224
00:09:43,711 --> 00:09:45,807
Any idea who took a shot at you?

225
00:09:45,842 --> 00:09:46,675
Nope.

226
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,303
No recent threats, nothing?

227
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,797
Look, I'm no snitch.

228
00:09:51,832 --> 00:09:53,517
Even if I did know, I can't talk.

229
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:54,446
I'm an artist.

230
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,282
I process tragedy through my work.

231
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:58,804
Would you prefer to process
tragedy back at the precinct?

232
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:01,537
'Cause I have a holding cell that
could really use an artist's touch.

233
00:10:01,572 --> 00:10:03,355
Yes, Benny, that favor you owe me,

234
00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:05,624
I'm calling in my IOU.

235
00:10:05,736 --> 00:10:08,604
Answer the detective's questions.

236
00:10:10,896 --> 00:10:13,732
Hector clashed with some punks
in Latin Kings colors that night.

237
00:10:13,766 --> 00:10:15,928
We were at capacity, they wanted in.

238
00:10:15,963 --> 00:10:18,131
They were making threats, they were upset.

239
00:10:20,358 --> 00:10:22,991
And you didn't mention this
at the crime scene because...?

240
00:10:23,026 --> 00:10:25,006
My fans aren't just buying shoes.

241
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,583
They're buying Benny Choi.

242
00:10:26,618 --> 00:10:29,448
Artist, activist, man of the people.

243
00:10:29,483 --> 00:10:30,849
You know, I wore colors back in the day.

244
00:10:30,883 --> 00:10:32,441
Asian Boyz. I was low level.

245
00:10:32,476 --> 00:10:33,556
You know, a punk.

246
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,081
Got out before the cops even knew my name.

247
00:10:35,155 --> 00:10:37,010
Ah, protecting your rep.

248
00:10:37,045 --> 00:10:39,583
Wouldn't want to risk that
seven-figure endorsement deal, would we?

249
00:10:39,618 --> 00:10:41,384
I didn't talk because if a Latin King hears

250
00:10:41,419 --> 00:10:44,583
an ex-Asian Boy done
dry-snitched him to the cops?

251
00:10:44,655 --> 00:10:47,349
Those thugs will retaliate on principal.

252
00:10:47,384 --> 00:10:48,739
I was trying to prevent more death.

253
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:50,928
Well, aren't we the little saint?

254
00:10:50,963 --> 00:10:52,404
Latin Kings versus Asian Boyz.

255
00:10:52,438 --> 00:10:53,712
That really narrows it down.

256
00:10:53,747 --> 00:10:55,551
Did you get names?

257
00:10:58,613 --> 00:11:00,303
Diego, Dani, I don't know.

258
00:11:00,338 --> 00:11:01,637
A couple, I think.

259
00:11:01,672 --> 00:11:02,814
Joined at the hip.

260
00:11:02,848 --> 00:11:04,170
Mm-hmm.

261
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,596
Diego and Dani. Right.

262
00:11:06,631 --> 00:11:09,466
You need to call me if
you remember anything else.

263
00:11:12,224 --> 00:11:13,677
Uh, yeah, I'll call.

264
00:11:13,712 --> 00:11:15,112
But be careful.

265
00:11:15,147 --> 00:11:17,073
Them Latin Kings about to raise hell.

266
00:11:17,108 --> 00:11:18,641
My "speciality."

267
00:11:21,634 --> 00:11:23,969
Did it ever occur to you to tell
me that you're tight with Benny?

268
00:11:24,004 --> 00:11:26,353
That you gave one of your
favors to a former gang felon?

269
00:11:26,388 --> 00:11:28,506
Well, I've been giving
favors for thousands of years.

270
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:29,753
Would you like a peek at my ledger?

271
00:11:29,788 --> 00:11:31,584
No, I'd like you to follow basic protocol.

272
00:11:31,619 --> 00:11:34,386
And I'd love to continue the debate
on our opposing views of police work,

273
00:11:34,421 --> 00:11:35,539
so how about we hit the cop bar,

274
00:11:35,574 --> 00:11:37,513
and get dangerous with
some bottom shelf, huh?

275
00:11:37,548 --> 00:11:39,282
A girl's dead and you
want to go on a pub crawl.

276
00:11:39,317 --> 00:11:40,570
Oh, liquid courage.

277
00:11:40,605 --> 00:11:43,638
I hear the Paddock Lounge is every
new detective's rite of passage.

278
00:11:43,707 --> 00:11:46,074
Forget it. We need to wait
for an I.D. on those kids.

279
00:11:46,109 --> 00:11:48,994
150,000 active gang members in L.A.,

280
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:49,820
it could take awhile.

281
00:11:49,855 --> 00:11:52,704
Oh, you're right. No time
for a quick drink, then.

282
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:53,778
We're on duty.

283
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,938
You are the oldest young
person I've ever met!

284
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:58,987
And coming from an immortal,
that's saying something.

285
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:04,177
Look, I'm not gonna drink at
a bar where everyone hates me.

286
00:12:04,212 --> 00:12:07,361
Did you ever consider they
hate you for that very reason?

287
00:12:07,396 --> 00:12:08,947
Yeah, they hate me for several reasons.

288
00:12:08,981 --> 00:12:11,314
Well, don't let those
Philistines inhibit your right

289
00:12:11,349 --> 00:12:14,113
to toast our first break
in the case... come on!

290
00:12:14,148 --> 00:12:15,032
It's the least you could do.

291
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,888
Besides, you know, I...

292
00:12:16,923 --> 00:12:19,046
need something to dull the pain.

293
00:12:19,081 --> 00:12:22,007
Ugh! If I say yes, will
you shut up about the leg?

294
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:23,638
No promises.

295
00:12:23,673 --> 00:12:26,665
Ooh! Aah!

296
00:12:34,857 --> 00:12:36,270
Here comes that bitch Decker.

297
00:12:36,305 --> 00:12:37,392
Who's the hell's that guy?

298
00:12:37,427 --> 00:12:38,610
Want me to lose this guy?

299
00:12:43,426 --> 00:12:44,637
It's Italian wool.

300
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,833
Touch it. I know you want to.

301
00:12:47,453 --> 00:12:48,687
Go on.

302
00:12:50,576 --> 00:12:52,644
Yeah. That'll do.

303
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,915
Well, somebody's not being
crowned homecoming queen, are they?

304
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,526
Yeah. Order. Please.

305
00:12:58,561 --> 00:12:59,578
Right.

306
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:02,070
Uh, two shots of your
finest swill, please, love.

307
00:13:02,105 --> 00:13:04,902
- You got it.
- I'll have a water.

308
00:13:06,239 --> 00:13:07,706
So, about this whole favor thing.

309
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,554
What... what is it?

310
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,545
What are you, some kind of loan shark?

311
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,816
Con man? Godfather with a twist?

312
00:13:13,851 --> 00:13:16,581
But surely you've heard the expression...

313
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,266
"Deal with the Devil"?

314
00:13:18,301 --> 00:13:19,951
- Mm!
- Come on, give me a break.

315
00:13:19,986 --> 00:13:21,396
No, people come to me to ask for favors,

316
00:13:21,431 --> 00:13:23,652
and more often than
not, I'm happy to oblige.

317
00:13:23,733 --> 00:13:24,711
What do <i>you</i> get?

318
00:13:24,746 --> 00:13:26,582
Well, sometimes, I have something in mind,

319
00:13:26,617 --> 00:13:27,737
but, usually, like with Benny,

320
00:13:27,772 --> 00:13:30,528
it's simply to be repaid at a later date.

321
00:13:30,571 --> 00:13:32,893
A devilish IOU, if you will.

322
00:13:32,991 --> 00:13:35,020
Who would take a deal like that?

323
00:13:35,597 --> 00:13:37,264
They <i>all</i> do.

324
00:13:38,774 --> 00:13:41,080
Palmetto Bitch.

325
00:13:44,564 --> 00:13:47,925
Ooh! Juicy! Do tell.

326
00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:52,256
That's Anthony Paolucci.

327
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:55,171
He's partners with the guy who took
a bullet in the Palmetto case...

328
00:13:55,206 --> 00:13:55,956
Malcolm Graham.

329
00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:58,784
Ah, yes, the infamous Palmetto.

330
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,769
Malcolm got shot meeting
with some gangsters,

331
00:14:00,804 --> 00:14:03,528
and... Paolucci thinks he took the bullet

332
00:14:03,563 --> 00:14:06,406
like a hero; I think he was on the take.

333
00:14:06,491 --> 00:14:08,970
Aha! So you're a snitch.

334
00:14:09,035 --> 00:14:11,624
A nog. No wonder nobody likes you.

335
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:13,178
Yeah, you'd think I was guilty of a crime.

336
00:14:13,267 --> 00:14:15,541
Yeah, you know what they say:
"Snitches end up in ditches."

337
00:14:15,643 --> 00:14:16,937
Oh, thanks, man.

338
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:18,305
I feel so much better.

339
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,208
Hm!

340
00:14:19,243 --> 00:14:20,800
No, I don't know, I just...

341
00:14:20,835 --> 00:14:22,965
was following my gut, I guess.

342
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,950
Caught in the crosshairs
of another man's crime.

343
00:14:25,004 --> 00:14:26,767
I don't need your sympathy, but thank you.

344
00:14:26,802 --> 00:14:27,601
Fair enough.

345
00:14:27,636 --> 00:14:29,888
Still, no excuse for that man's rudeness.

346
00:14:29,922 --> 00:14:31,331
No, no, no, no... I can handle Paolucci.

347
00:14:31,366 --> 00:14:32,924
I don't need you to stand up for me.

348
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,492
Understood.

349
00:14:36,945 --> 00:14:38,217
Excuse me.

350
00:14:38,526 --> 00:14:39,883
Hello.

351
00:14:39,918 --> 00:14:41,023
- What do you want?
- Well, firstly,

352
00:14:41,058 --> 00:14:42,152
let me state that I'm in no way

353
00:14:42,187 --> 00:14:44,780
standing up for my
associate, Detective Decker.

354
00:14:44,848 --> 00:14:47,305
But on behalf of myself, and only myself,

355
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,474
I think you're a complete sack of ass.

356
00:14:52,211 --> 00:14:54,746
Are you crazy? Let's get out of here.

357
00:15:02,104 --> 00:15:03,417
And your name?

358
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:05,256
Mazikeen.

359
00:15:05,974 --> 00:15:08,004
How do you spell that?

360
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,121
Surprise me.

361
00:15:11,966 --> 00:15:14,468
Interesting choice of venue.

362
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:16,689
What, are you trying
to throw me off-balance?

363
00:15:16,724 --> 00:15:20,251
Because I'm much more comfortable
among humans than you might think.

364
00:15:20,913 --> 00:15:22,944
So I see.

365
00:15:26,445 --> 00:15:29,299
This is my favorite place in the city.

366
00:15:29,334 --> 00:15:30,282
Really?

367
00:15:30,352 --> 00:15:31,803
Look at them on their laptops,

368
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:33,862
writing the next great screenplay,

369
00:15:33,951 --> 00:15:36,373
torturing themselves with dreams they know,

370
00:15:36,408 --> 00:15:39,910
deep down, they will never achieve.

371
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,828
Reminds me of home.

372
00:15:42,862 --> 00:15:44,671
Get to the point.

373
00:15:45,965 --> 00:15:48,096
I want to go back.

374
00:15:48,557 --> 00:15:50,692
Then give me something, Maze.

375
00:15:50,876 --> 00:15:52,749
Give me something that I
can use against Lucifer,

376
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,609
and I'll make sure you're
both back where you belong.

377
00:15:54,644 --> 00:15:55,874
That's the problem.

378
00:15:55,908 --> 00:15:58,283
He doesn't confide in me anymore.

379
00:15:58,841 --> 00:15:59,874
But...

380
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:04,237
there is someone he
does talk to... a doctor.

381
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:08,248
And I bet she would love
that ridiculous suit.

382
00:16:08,566 --> 00:16:11,482
And here I thought you
were the loyal soldier.

383
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:14,170
I want what's best for Lucifer.

384
00:16:14,662 --> 00:16:16,848
Same thing you want.

385
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:19,590
Then tell me about this doctor...

386
00:16:21,723 --> 00:16:24,054
..."Mike."

387
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:43,350
Hello?

388
00:16:43,515 --> 00:16:46,150
Is anybody there?

389
00:16:52,576 --> 00:16:54,597
I know Krav Maga!

390
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,121
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.

391
00:17:15,156 --> 00:17:17,044
How did you get in here?

392
00:17:17,096 --> 00:17:18,764
I have a key.

393
00:17:20,116 --> 00:17:21,526
Yeah, let me start over.

394
00:17:21,561 --> 00:17:24,859
Uh, I actually just moved
into the office next-door.

395
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:27,121
I'm Dr. Canaan.

396
00:17:27,183 --> 00:17:28,920
Oh, okay.

397
00:17:28,955 --> 00:17:30,733
Hi. Uh, I'm Linda.

398
00:17:30,768 --> 00:17:33,139
Uh, Dr. Martin.

399
00:17:39,908 --> 00:17:41,731
It's fantastic, actually.

400
00:17:41,766 --> 00:17:43,099
The thrill of fighting humans

401
00:17:43,134 --> 00:17:46,002
has taken on a whole new spin,
now that I might get hurt.

402
00:17:46,037 --> 00:17:49,805
Although, sadly, the only thing broken
was that incontinent troll's nose.

403
00:17:49,898 --> 00:17:52,825
- Your behavior is foolish.
- Oh, come on!

404
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,855
You used to love danger.

405
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:57,966
Since when did Hell's favorite
torturer become my mother?

406
00:17:58,001 --> 00:17:59,454
You're changing.

407
00:17:59,489 --> 00:18:01,037
Becoming vulnerable.

408
00:18:01,139 --> 00:18:03,597
Maybe even... mortal.

409
00:18:03,678 --> 00:18:05,489
Mm!

410
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:10,010
If I'm not going to look
out for you, who will? Hmm?

411
00:18:10,086 --> 00:18:12,106
- Your pet cop?
- That's what partners are for.

412
00:18:12,141 --> 00:18:14,415
She is not your partner.

413
00:18:14,504 --> 00:18:16,939
Have you two been talking?

414
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:24,698
You know, I actually don't think it's
my mortality that you're worried about.

415
00:18:24,794 --> 00:18:28,883
You're just jealous that I'm
exploring it with Detective Decker.

416
00:18:31,784 --> 00:18:33,860
Jealous of a mortal woman?

417
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:35,558
Mm-hmm.

418
00:18:35,641 --> 00:18:37,219
I don't think so.

419
00:18:37,254 --> 00:18:39,894
But if you insist on
continuing this exploration,

420
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:42,147
maybe next time, I won't
be around to save your ass.

421
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:43,526
Mm! Well, that <i>is</i> a shame.

422
00:18:43,561 --> 00:18:46,074
'Cause you and my backside
used to get on very well.

423
00:18:46,109 --> 00:18:48,067
My front side, as well, actually.

424
00:18:48,102 --> 00:18:49,085
Things change, Lucifer.

425
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,811
Yes, but you don't, Maze.

426
00:18:52,414 --> 00:18:54,781
You exist to protect me.

427
00:18:54,816 --> 00:18:57,811
To know where I am and
who I'm with at all times,

428
00:18:57,846 --> 00:19:00,369
whether you want to, or not.

429
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:13,304
Pretty sure your name's not on the list.

430
00:19:13,389 --> 00:19:14,789
It should be.

431
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,734
Considering I've just spent
the last couple of hours

432
00:19:16,815 --> 00:19:19,674
convincing Anthony Paolucci
not to press charges.

433
00:19:20,642 --> 00:19:22,131
Well, what if I want to press charges?

434
00:19:22,175 --> 00:19:24,011
- For what?
- Stupidity.

435
00:19:24,046 --> 00:19:26,913
A drunk, on-duty cop...
surely that's a no-no.

436
00:19:26,948 --> 00:19:28,724
But don't worry, I'm feeling charitable.

437
00:19:28,774 --> 00:19:30,924
I'll let it slide this time.

438
00:19:32,565 --> 00:19:34,433
Is it my thanks you want, or a kiss?

439
00:19:34,468 --> 00:19:36,264
I don't want your thanks.

440
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:38,759
Because I don't do
favors for guys like you.

441
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,065
I did this for Chloe.

442
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,886
Oh, stop raining on
the poor woman's parade.

443
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:46,634
It's about time she got
some spark in her life.

444
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,683
Spark?

445
00:19:49,729 --> 00:19:51,395
How about real danger?

446
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:55,131
Do you have any idea how easy a gang
vendetta can spiral out of control?

447
00:19:55,207 --> 00:19:58,174
Well, I'm trying my best to find out. Yeah.

448
00:19:58,209 --> 00:20:00,109
That's exactly why I'm here.

449
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,787
Chloe is the mother of
my child, you imbecile.

450
00:20:04,385 --> 00:20:06,435
You want to work this case?

451
00:20:06,989 --> 00:20:08,782
Take care of her.

452
00:20:09,191 --> 00:20:11,764
Sir, yes, sir.

453
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:24,905
<i>Okay, Latin Kings turf.</i>

454
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,534
<i>You need to have my back on this.</i>

455
00:20:26,621 --> 00:20:28,434
<i>You can count on me, Detective.</i>

456
00:20:28,469 --> 00:20:30,945
All right, Dani and Diego Ramirez.

457
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,015
Married straight out
of juvie; real hotheads.

458
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34,649
Ooh! Do we get to kick in the door?

459
00:20:34,683 --> 00:20:37,451
As your self-sacrificing
partner, I volunteer to go first.

460
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,099
No, there'll be no kicking in of anything,

461
00:20:39,134 --> 00:20:40,286
unless we have a warrant,

462
00:20:40,321 --> 00:20:42,686
or people are in immediate danger.

463
00:20:42,964 --> 00:20:44,912
You better start taking
this case seriously.

464
00:20:44,983 --> 00:20:46,405
If this escalates to a gang war...

465
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,356
Yes, yes, it could spiral out of control...

466
00:20:48,391 --> 00:20:50,507
blood could run in the
streets, fire could rain down.

467
00:20:50,573 --> 00:20:52,663
You sound just like your ex.

468
00:20:53,237 --> 00:20:55,052
What do you mean... you spoke to Dan?

469
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:55,885
Mm!

470
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,383
He dropped by Lux.

471
00:20:57,418 --> 00:20:59,231
Kept rambling on about keeping you safe.

472
00:20:59,266 --> 00:21:01,521
Quite condescending, if you ask me.

473
00:21:01,623 --> 00:21:03,502
What is it with the men in my life?

474
00:21:03,537 --> 00:21:06,372
I'm a man in your life?

475
00:21:11,974 --> 00:21:14,823
Uh, Detective, you seem to have
left on the central locking!

476
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:16,606
Act like a child, get treated like a child.

477
00:21:16,641 --> 00:21:20,595
Wha...? Isn't it illegal to
leave your child locked in a car?

478
00:21:32,548 --> 00:21:35,512
Diego and Dani Ramirez, LAPD.

479
00:21:35,638 --> 00:21:37,494
Need to ask you a few questions.

480
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,357
LAPD! Open up!

481
00:21:43,392 --> 00:21:45,061
Come on, baby.

482
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:47,231
Let me make you feel better.

483
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,096
Who the hell are you?!

484
00:22:02,131 --> 00:22:03,864
What are you doing here?!

485
00:22:04,732 --> 00:22:07,234
What are you doing in my house, man?!

486
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,429
How the hell did you get out of the car?

487
00:22:10,464 --> 00:22:11,960
Child's play, and good thing I did.

488
00:22:12,032 --> 00:22:13,685
There was immediate danger.

489
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:16,259
He was about to leave this
woman completely unsatisfied.

490
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:18,054
- What the...?!
- Hey! Hey!

491
00:22:18,089 --> 00:22:19,907
- Down.
- He's your partner?

492
00:22:19,942 --> 00:22:21,663
Yeah, don't get me started.

493
00:22:21,698 --> 00:22:23,383
Cops harass us no matter what we do!

494
00:22:23,418 --> 00:22:25,428
And now they're breaking into our house?!

495
00:22:25,513 --> 00:22:26,757
I should sue that pervert!

496
00:22:26,792 --> 00:22:27,742
You have my blessing.

497
00:22:27,777 --> 00:22:29,315
But first, let's talk Benny Choi.

498
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:32,092
Yes, did you attempt to use him
as target practice the other night?

499
00:22:32,127 --> 00:22:32,851
- That wasn't us!
- No.

500
00:22:32,886 --> 00:22:35,373
Okay, well, witnesses said they
heard you making threats at the door.

501
00:22:35,408 --> 00:22:37,150
No, we-we just wanted in.

502
00:22:37,185 --> 00:22:38,740
We wanted a pair of Benny's sweet kicks.

503
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,432
Enough to pay for them
with Paola Cortez's blood?

504
00:22:41,467 --> 00:22:43,400
Paola was Diego's cousin, okay?

505
00:22:43,435 --> 00:22:45,154
It's wack what happened to her.

506
00:22:45,189 --> 00:22:47,730
Why do you think he's so upset?

507
00:22:49,565 --> 00:22:51,959
I promised I'd get her in the show.

508
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:56,529
There wasn't enough room for
three, so... we gave her our spot.

509
00:22:57,422 --> 00:22:58,904
She wanted to be a designer.

510
00:22:58,939 --> 00:23:01,450
Sorry, is that, is that flop sweat

511
00:23:01,485 --> 00:23:02,489
or is that a tear?

512
00:23:02,523 --> 00:23:05,041
That's... Oh...

513
00:23:05,076 --> 00:23:06,187
Oh, bloody hell.

514
00:23:06,222 --> 00:23:07,557
This is our bad guy?

515
00:23:07,592 --> 00:23:09,777
No wonder he can't get it up.

516
00:23:10,778 --> 00:23:12,546
Look, uh...

517
00:23:12,581 --> 00:23:14,034
if you didn't take a shot at Benny,

518
00:23:14,068 --> 00:23:17,334
then help us get justice for Paola.

519
00:23:18,004 --> 00:23:20,161
Tell us what you know, all right?

520
00:23:23,956 --> 00:23:27,090
If anyone had beef with
Benny Choi, it's Yellow Viper.

521
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:28,281
"Yellow Viper"?

522
00:23:28,316 --> 00:23:29,996
Sounds like a venereal disease.

523
00:23:30,031 --> 00:23:32,814
He got out of jail a few
nights before Benny's show.

524
00:23:32,849 --> 00:23:35,342
He was a big-deal graffiti artist,
ran with Benny back in the day,

525
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:37,364
then took the fall on some B&E.

526
00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:39,806
He got five and change, while
Benny got rich and famous.

527
00:23:39,841 --> 00:23:43,953
Well, it does sound like this Viper
fellow has every reason to punish Benny.

528
00:23:43,988 --> 00:23:45,595
We need to present a unified front.

529
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:47,363
Speculate later, not in front of them.

530
00:23:47,398 --> 00:23:48,368
Got it.

531
00:23:48,582 --> 00:23:51,450
So, Viper's beef killed
your cousin then, eh?

532
00:23:52,024 --> 00:23:53,223
What? That wasn't speculation.

533
00:23:53,258 --> 00:23:54,768
That was a statement of potential fact.

534
00:23:54,803 --> 00:23:55,972
And if we ever run into him,

535
00:23:56,037 --> 00:23:57,789
he won't have to worry about no cops.

536
00:23:57,828 --> 00:23:59,753
So you're just gonna sit
around and wait for revenge?

537
00:23:59,788 --> 00:24:01,014
That's rather lazy.

538
00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:02,647
Okay, this is the opposite of helping.

539
00:24:02,682 --> 00:24:04,251
What? I was promised a gang war.

540
00:24:04,285 --> 00:24:06,386
Instead I get a cry baby. This is boring.

541
00:24:06,505 --> 00:24:07,220
All right, tough.

542
00:24:07,255 --> 00:24:10,090
Right now, we need to warn Benny
that his buddy Viper's back in town.

543
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:12,890
My apologies for him.

544
00:24:15,793 --> 00:24:17,830
Thanks ever so.

545
00:24:17,865 --> 00:24:19,771
Ooh, let me guess.

546
00:24:19,806 --> 00:24:22,269
Anemic sext from Sir Douche?

547
00:24:22,613 --> 00:24:24,237
No, from Benny.

548
00:24:25,232 --> 00:24:26,838
Someone else is dead.

549
00:24:26,873 --> 00:24:29,570
Ooh, less boring!

550
00:24:36,531 --> 00:24:37,686
Benny?

551
00:24:37,788 --> 00:24:39,470
Some street artist.

552
00:24:39,505 --> 00:24:40,454
Oh, dear.

553
00:24:42,682 --> 00:24:44,861
Crazy guess: That's not paint.

554
00:24:44,896 --> 00:24:46,954
Mm.

555
00:24:47,088 --> 00:24:48,968
Definitely blood, though.

556
00:24:49,161 --> 00:24:51,064
But curiously, not human.

557
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,335
Benny?

558
00:24:55,413 --> 00:24:57,229
Poor Diddy.

559
00:25:00,608 --> 00:25:02,288
This is the murder?

560
00:25:02,323 --> 00:25:04,568
I'm sorry. I didn't know who else to call.

561
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:06,572
Ain't no 911 for pets.

562
00:25:06,681 --> 00:25:08,912
Bacon for dinner, I guess.

563
00:25:09,346 --> 00:25:13,130
And my deepest condolences, Benny.

564
00:25:13,165 --> 00:25:14,761
What happened?

565
00:25:14,876 --> 00:25:17,020
Hector and I went to an opening.

566
00:25:17,142 --> 00:25:19,192
Came back to find...

567
00:25:19,592 --> 00:25:20,894
it's Pig Diddy.

568
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,889
Were you aware that your
old friend Yellow Viper

569
00:25:22,924 --> 00:25:24,965
was released from prison last week?

570
00:25:25,103 --> 00:25:26,757
No, I had no idea he was out.

571
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:29,119
No phone calls? No contact?

572
00:25:29,154 --> 00:25:31,338
I sent him letters when
he was inside San Quentin.

573
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:33,251
Money for lawyers, too.

574
00:25:33,318 --> 00:25:34,963
But he sent the letters back all torn up.

575
00:25:34,998 --> 00:25:36,525
Didn't take a dime.

576
00:25:36,617 --> 00:25:39,011
I always felt bad for
how things turned out.

577
00:25:39,161 --> 00:25:40,397
How I got lucky.

578
00:25:40,432 --> 00:25:42,028
Viper went down.

579
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:42,918
He was my best friend...

580
00:25:42,953 --> 00:25:45,470
Well, with friends like
that, I'd hide the knives.

581
00:25:45,505 --> 00:25:47,183
Yeah, Viper must've snuck into my show.

582
00:25:47,276 --> 00:25:48,927
He fired those shots.

583
00:25:48,962 --> 00:25:51,201
Killing Pig Diddy was a message.

584
00:25:51,236 --> 00:25:54,248
All right, we'll get a squad
car to watch your house tonight.

585
00:25:54,283 --> 00:25:55,683
Viper comes by, you'll be safe.

586
00:25:55,718 --> 00:25:57,411
Aw, y'all don't know him like I do.

587
00:25:57,446 --> 00:26:00,536
He's fierce. He won't stop
till it's my blood on the floor.

588
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:04,761
Thanks, Benny.

589
00:26:06,336 --> 00:26:09,315
You know, they really don't
make bad guys like they used to.

590
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,211
We need to get word to
Viper's parole officer.

591
00:26:11,305 --> 00:26:12,974
Track him down before he can get to Benny.

592
00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:14,181
Finally, some real action.

593
00:26:14,282 --> 00:26:18,118
I'm more than ready to face the
danger of the notorious Yellow Viper.

594
00:26:23,021 --> 00:26:26,562
Oh!

595
00:26:27,524 --> 00:26:29,625
Hello there, neighbor.

596
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:31,201
Is everything okay?

597
00:26:31,236 --> 00:26:33,440
I was just wondering if you
would care to grab a drink?

598
00:26:33,475 --> 00:26:35,304
- Oh?
- Yes.

599
00:26:35,339 --> 00:26:38,205
I actually need someone to confide in.

600
00:26:38,448 --> 00:26:40,007
"Confide in"?

601
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:43,404
About a patient; a troubling one.

602
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:44,411
Oh, oh.

603
00:26:44,503 --> 00:26:47,541
So, a-a doctor, a
doctor-to-doctor thing.

604
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:48,415
Exactly.

605
00:26:48,449 --> 00:26:52,548
And, hey, listen, if you have any
patients you need to talk about...

606
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:54,749
You have no idea.

607
00:26:54,812 --> 00:26:56,792
Good, so it's settled then.

608
00:26:56,909 --> 00:26:59,060
You share with me, I share with you.

609
00:26:59,156 --> 00:27:01,205
A fluid exchange.

610
00:27:04,439 --> 00:27:06,574
Maybe one drink.

611
00:27:09,025 --> 00:27:10,077
<i>I mean, seriously,</i>

612
00:27:10,112 --> 00:27:10,963
a community center?

613
00:27:10,998 --> 00:27:13,774
This is where we'll find
the deadly Yellow Viper?

614
00:27:13,808 --> 00:27:14,967
According to his parole officer.

615
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:18,745
Oh, after five years behind
bars, a brothel would be my go-to.

616
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:23,584
You know, I've been thinking about
that favor that you gave Benny.

617
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,154
Did it also involve getting
him off on the felony B&E charge

618
00:27:26,189 --> 00:27:27,762
that put Viper in prison instead?

619
00:27:27,845 --> 00:27:30,357
Well, I may have pulled
a few strings... why?

620
00:27:30,391 --> 00:27:31,673
Well, if Viper hadn't have gone to prison,

621
00:27:31,708 --> 00:27:33,760
he wouldn't have targeted
Benny and shot up his show,

622
00:27:33,795 --> 00:27:35,802
which means Paola Cortez
would still be alive.

623
00:27:35,837 --> 00:27:38,423
Wait, you're not seriously
blaming me for that girl's death?

624
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:39,274
Just stating fact.

625
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:40,701
Cause and effect; intended or not.

626
00:27:40,735 --> 00:27:42,035
No, no. I-I can't be held responsible

627
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:44,962
for what happens after
I give someone a favor.

628
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:46,540
I mean, if there's one
thing the Devil knows,

629
00:27:46,574 --> 00:27:48,242
it's that people need
to take responsibility

630
00:27:48,276 --> 00:27:49,830
for their own bad behavior.

631
00:27:49,865 --> 00:27:54,252
Yes, people do need to take
responsibility for their own bad behavior.

632
00:27:55,377 --> 00:27:57,058
I just said that.

633
00:27:57,194 --> 00:27:59,295
Are you hearing impaired?

634
00:28:08,462 --> 00:28:09,844
Remember...

635
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:13,365
tagging means nothing if it
doesn't come from right here.

636
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,901
Hmm.

637
00:28:15,267 --> 00:28:17,378
Yellow Viper, I presume.

638
00:28:17,413 --> 00:28:19,735
He's teaching art to youngsters.

639
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,627
I mean, this bad guy thing's
gonna be all the joke now.

640
00:28:21,683 --> 00:28:23,277
What next... cuddles and ice cream?

641
00:28:34,418 --> 00:28:36,030
Private class.

642
00:28:36,065 --> 00:28:37,294
I'm Detective Decker.

643
00:28:37,329 --> 00:28:38,812
This is... Never mind.

644
00:28:38,847 --> 00:28:41,984
I need to ask you a few questions about
the shooting at Benny's fashion show.

645
00:28:42,019 --> 00:28:43,956
You got a warrant?

646
00:28:44,178 --> 00:28:45,893
If not...

647
00:28:45,928 --> 00:28:46,867
beat it.

648
00:28:46,901 --> 00:28:48,124
I'm not talking to cops.

649
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,470
Ooh, do you have something
to hide, Mr. Viper?

650
00:28:50,505 --> 00:28:52,663
Or do you go by Yellow?

651
00:28:52,737 --> 00:28:56,682
Oh, you think I'm gonna let you
bust my balls in front of these kids?

652
00:28:56,778 --> 00:29:00,377
Arrest me or step off.

653
00:29:03,214 --> 00:29:04,660
Ooh, charming.

654
00:29:04,695 --> 00:29:06,422
- Is everything okay?
- Well, he's right.

655
00:29:06,457 --> 00:29:07,799
He doesn't have to talk to us.

656
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,042
He really seems to care about those kids.

657
00:29:10,113 --> 00:29:11,358
It's odd for a criminal.

658
00:29:11,393 --> 00:29:12,962
Or anyone, really.

659
00:29:12,997 --> 00:29:14,261
You know, if you spent as much time

660
00:29:14,296 --> 00:29:16,458
appealing to suspects
as you do annoying me,

661
00:29:16,493 --> 00:29:19,146
things might go...

662
00:29:19,263 --> 00:29:21,212
go a lot faster.

663
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:37,965
Our lucky day.

664
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,469
Viper and the perv.

665
00:29:39,504 --> 00:29:43,055
Bravo, crybaby. This is
a bold move, isn't it?

666
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:45,133
Come on, turn around.

667
00:29:45,168 --> 00:29:47,115
If you walk away now, no
one has to get arrested.

668
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:48,178
No one has to get hurt...

669
00:29:48,213 --> 00:29:49,888
Yeah, they do. Viper killed my cousin.

670
00:29:49,923 --> 00:29:52,166
- I'm here to get justice!
- As you should.

671
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,176
Are you insane? Shut up.

672
00:29:54,211 --> 00:29:55,585
What?

673
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,374
Please, I promise we're dealing with this.

674
00:29:57,409 --> 00:30:01,542
You and your perv partner want to get
caught in the crossfire, cop, be my guest.

675
00:30:02,663 --> 00:30:04,707
Smoke this piece!

676
00:30:09,584 --> 00:30:11,085
Enough danger for you yet?

677
00:30:11,154 --> 00:30:12,545
Just stay there. Stay there.

678
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,351
I'm curious.

679
00:30:17,757 --> 00:30:18,856
Right.

680
00:30:25,793 --> 00:30:28,207
This ain't about you, it's about Viper!

681
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,925
Hey, now if you'd just give
that gun I'd asked for...

682
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,848
- Stop talking.
- Okay.

683
00:30:33,772 --> 00:30:35,243
Diego?

684
00:30:35,682 --> 00:30:38,092
Diego, put down your weapon.

685
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,769
Don't listen to her.

686
00:30:39,858 --> 00:30:40,763
This isn't what you want.

687
00:30:40,845 --> 00:30:43,545
Taking down Viper is exactly what he wants.

688
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,514
We're doing it for Paola! Step off!

689
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,271
I said step off!

690
00:30:48,306 --> 00:30:49,704
You know, as the Master of Punishment,

691
00:30:49,739 --> 00:30:52,055
I completely understand
your desire to make Viper pay

692
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:53,695
for the tragic death of your cousin...

693
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:55,898
Lucifer, you do remember
that bullets hurt, right?

694
00:30:56,012 --> 00:30:59,541
And furthermore, you do seem to
have this danger thing down pat,

695
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:00,546
don't you?

696
00:31:00,581 --> 00:31:02,258
I mean the Devil could
learn a thing or two.

697
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:03,705
The Devil? The hell you talking about?

698
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,194
So, answer me this:

699
00:31:05,229 --> 00:31:08,575
So, you engage in turf wars, yet
nobody actually owns any turf?

700
00:31:08,672 --> 00:31:09,749
Get back, freak!

701
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:10,851
All right, let's finish this.

702
00:31:10,886 --> 00:31:13,863
And-and those trousers. I
mean, you wear them so low that,

703
00:31:13,898 --> 00:31:15,600
well, your ass is exposed
to other naughty men,

704
00:31:15,668 --> 00:31:17,397
and we all know what kind
of danger that can bring,

705
00:31:17,432 --> 00:31:19,608
don't we? I mean, you can
park your bike in there.

706
00:31:19,643 --> 00:31:21,230
You making fun of his pants, yo?

707
00:31:21,265 --> 00:31:22,733
Well, are we talking pants or trousers?

708
00:31:22,768 --> 00:31:24,930
Because it's very confusing.

709
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:27,511
Where'd he go?

710
00:31:28,462 --> 00:31:30,721
- Oh, dear.
- Don't matter.

711
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:32,824
I'll kill you first.

712
00:31:35,366 --> 00:31:36,078
Hey, what's happening?

713
00:31:36,113 --> 00:31:38,746
Where's Viper?

714
00:31:38,781 --> 00:31:41,554
You had your hero moment... stay
down, or you're gonna get shot!

715
00:31:41,589 --> 00:31:43,323
Indeed!

716
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:48,357
What's that? What happened?

717
00:31:51,435 --> 00:31:53,851
What the hell is happening?

718
00:31:57,867 --> 00:31:59,101
Maze is happening.

719
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:00,227
Your bartender's a ninja?

720
00:32:00,262 --> 00:32:01,730
- Of course she is.
- Yeah.

721
00:32:01,765 --> 00:32:03,572
What's that?

722
00:32:05,474 --> 00:32:07,299
Shattered tibia.

723
00:32:07,948 --> 00:32:10,412
Ooh, ouch... orbital fracture.

724
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:15,664
It was first perfected
in the hellfires of Tyre.

725
00:32:17,453 --> 00:32:20,222
Oh, the humerus crush!

726
00:32:20,256 --> 00:32:23,189
Love that Maze!

727
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:45,047
Oh, bravo, Detective.

728
00:32:49,254 --> 00:32:50,552
Ass saved.

729
00:32:50,586 --> 00:32:51,553
You're welcome.

730
00:32:51,588 --> 00:32:54,474
His ass, not yours.

731
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:10,848
Let's go.

732
00:33:18,047 --> 00:33:19,715
Care to tell me what happened?

733
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:23,210
You wouldn't believe me if I did.

734
00:33:24,464 --> 00:33:26,899
They found a gun in Viper's bag.

735
00:33:27,113 --> 00:33:30,526
It's a .38. Same caliber
fired at Benny's show.

736
00:33:31,613 --> 00:33:32,894
Um...

737
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:34,080
What?

738
00:33:34,214 --> 00:33:35,892
You should know something.

739
00:33:35,927 --> 00:33:36,532
Okay.

740
00:33:36,567 --> 00:33:38,433
I talked to Lucifer
about you the other day.

741
00:33:38,523 --> 00:33:39,976
Yeah, I heard.

742
00:33:40,058 --> 00:33:41,746
I mean, not that it got me anywhere.

743
00:33:41,781 --> 00:33:45,082
If anyone can handle themselves
around that wack job, it's you.

744
00:33:45,808 --> 00:33:47,743
And, hey, it looks like, uh...

745
00:33:47,972 --> 00:33:49,894
you got the bad guy.

746
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:53,015
Yeah.

747
00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:55,244
Looks like.

748
00:34:09,992 --> 00:34:11,800
What, no "thank you"?

749
00:34:12,518 --> 00:34:13,637
I don't know why you're upset.

750
00:34:13,715 --> 00:34:15,604
I helped save kids.

751
00:34:15,692 --> 00:34:16,838
And we arrested our shooter.

752
00:34:16,873 --> 00:34:18,364
One might say I did you a favor.

753
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:19,551
Hmm.

754
00:34:19,586 --> 00:34:22,308
Yeah, I think I just figured
it out, why you do these favors.

755
00:34:22,343 --> 00:34:24,324
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

756
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:25,675
It's about power.

757
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:27,120
It makes you feel superior.

758
00:34:27,155 --> 00:34:28,429
In control.

759
00:34:28,464 --> 00:34:30,897
You're addicted to creating chaos
and seeing where the chips fall,

760
00:34:30,932 --> 00:34:32,687
to hell with the consequences.

761
00:34:32,761 --> 00:34:35,460
It's like you have some
kind of god complex.

762
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,537
I most certainly do not.

763
00:34:37,572 --> 00:34:39,915
You do a favor for one
person, someone else suffers.

764
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:41,429
When you gave Benny that favor,

765
00:34:41,464 --> 00:34:42,840
you damned Viper to prison.

766
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:44,056
Twice.

767
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:46,370
Whether he's guilty or not.

768
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,216
What?

769
00:35:06,251 --> 00:35:07,157
Stop staring.

770
00:35:07,192 --> 00:35:09,451
You're having another one of
those "gut feelings," aren't you?

771
00:35:09,486 --> 00:35:11,498
Like you had on the Palmetto case.

772
00:35:11,624 --> 00:35:13,234
This has nothing to do with Palmetto.

773
00:35:13,269 --> 00:35:14,201
Au contraire.

774
00:35:14,236 --> 00:35:15,818
I think it has everything to do with it.

775
00:35:15,853 --> 00:35:18,102
See? Addicted to creating
chaos, talking out of your ass...

776
00:35:18,162 --> 00:35:20,022
Like I said: you were
trusting your instincts

777
00:35:20,057 --> 00:35:22,936
on that case, just like
you're trusting them now.

778
00:35:22,971 --> 00:35:27,943
I mean, why would a seasoned parolee
bring a gun to a children's art class?

779
00:35:27,978 --> 00:35:29,377
For all we know, Mr. Viper is innocent.

780
00:35:29,459 --> 00:35:32,314
I am innocent, man!

781
00:35:32,348 --> 00:35:33,289
See?

782
00:35:33,324 --> 00:35:35,114
What do you know? Our suspect has ears.

783
00:35:35,149 --> 00:35:38,142
Let's see if he has a
conscience, as well, shall we?

784
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:39,354
Mr. Viper.

785
00:35:39,389 --> 00:35:41,495
Mr. Viper...

786
00:35:42,141 --> 00:35:43,492
Hello.

787
00:35:43,526 --> 00:35:46,358
You've already wasted so much of your life.

788
00:35:46,689 --> 00:35:50,201
What do you desire to do with
the rest of your time on Earth?

789
00:35:50,979 --> 00:35:53,123
All I want to do is my art.

790
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:56,520
I swear I didn't shoot up Benny's show.

791
00:35:56,555 --> 00:36:00,972
If I hated him so much, why would
I bother to go after him and miss?

792
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,674
Oh.

793
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,936
Yes, he's got a point, actually.

794
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:07,525
I mean, to pop off in a crowd
like that and not hit anyone,

795
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,162
he'd have to be the
worst shot in the world.

796
00:36:10,515 --> 00:36:12,510
Or the best.

797
00:36:15,992 --> 00:36:18,225
Steady on, Detective.

798
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:27,222
It's my Pig Diddy piece.

799
00:36:27,257 --> 00:36:29,982
Collector in Dubai
offered me 150 G's for it.

800
00:36:30,052 --> 00:36:31,457
I want you to have it.

801
00:36:31,492 --> 00:36:33,212
As thanks for saving my life.

802
00:36:33,247 --> 00:36:34,083
Again.

803
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,528
Yes, my favor really did pay
off for you, didn't it, Benny?

804
00:36:38,606 --> 00:36:39,808
You're a huge star.

805
00:36:41,253 --> 00:36:44,488
But if there's one thing the
Devil abhors, it's a fake.

806
00:36:44,523 --> 00:36:46,119
What are you talking about?

807
00:36:46,154 --> 00:36:47,508
I'm all about authenticity.

808
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:50,164
Sure. Except for the lying.

809
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:53,264
You failed to inform me that in
getting you off the B&E charge,

810
00:36:53,334 --> 00:36:56,214
suspicion would immediately
fall on your best friend.

811
00:36:56,249 --> 00:36:57,947
I had no control over that.

812
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,446
Didn't you?

813
00:36:59,598 --> 00:37:01,398
Oh...

814
00:37:02,234 --> 00:37:03,456
Hey, it's good to see you, man.

815
00:37:03,491 --> 00:37:04,875
I missed you, bro.

816
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,827
That why you never came
to visit me in prison?

817
00:37:06,862 --> 00:37:08,106
I wish I could've done more.

818
00:37:08,141 --> 00:37:10,719
Framing him for shooting up your
fashion show surely didn't help.

819
00:37:10,754 --> 00:37:11,973
Viper was always the real talent.

820
00:37:12,075 --> 00:37:14,753
When you heard he was getting released,
you tried to take down the competition

821
00:37:14,788 --> 00:37:16,366
before he could take down you.

822
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,269
Planned a simple frame job.

823
00:37:18,304 --> 00:37:20,398
Parole violation that would
send Viper back to prison.

824
00:37:20,433 --> 00:37:23,142
But when Paola Cortez died, you
had to improvise, didn't you?

825
00:37:23,177 --> 00:37:26,483
You knew pointing the fingers at Latin
Kings would eventually get back to me.

826
00:37:26,591 --> 00:37:28,721
How the hell could I have
staged that frame job?

827
00:37:28,756 --> 00:37:30,974
How could I have pointed a gun at myself?

828
00:37:31,075 --> 00:37:32,559
Because you didn't pull the trigger.

829
00:37:32,646 --> 00:37:34,833
So many bullets fired into that crowd.

830
00:37:34,868 --> 00:37:36,917
How did no one get hit?

831
00:37:36,952 --> 00:37:38,269
That takes precision.

832
00:37:38,304 --> 00:37:41,000
I saw your Marine tattoo
when I met you, Hector.

833
00:37:41,086 --> 00:37:43,548
A heart in crosshairs. Sniper unit.

834
00:37:43,583 --> 00:37:45,997
Best marksmen in the world.

835
00:37:46,082 --> 00:37:50,200
Did you know firing a gun
into a crowd is a felony?

836
00:37:50,302 --> 00:37:52,055
You're responsible for Paola's murder.

837
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:55,493
Unless, of course, you were
just doing someone a favor.

838
00:37:55,613 --> 00:37:59,674
- No, man. Hey...
- Benny made me do it! I'll testify, man.

839
00:37:59,756 --> 00:38:01,539
He told me he'd make me a partner.

840
00:38:01,574 --> 00:38:05,221
But then he made me plant the gun on Viper.

841
00:38:06,279 --> 00:38:08,414
And kill Pig Diddy.

842
00:38:10,148 --> 00:38:11,918
I loved that pig, man.

843
00:38:11,953 --> 00:38:12,822
Oh...

844
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:16,020
Well, the good news is that
whilst all dogs go to Heaven,

845
00:38:16,143 --> 00:38:19,781
you'd be surprised how many
pigs are waiting for you in Hell.

846
00:38:19,816 --> 00:38:21,256
Okay, let's go.

847
00:38:21,319 --> 00:38:22,360
You were never good as me, man.

848
00:38:22,423 --> 00:38:23,533
You were never good as me, man!

849
00:38:23,568 --> 00:38:24,456
- Never!
- What?

850
00:38:24,491 --> 00:38:26,670
I don't think so, Sonny G.

851
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:28,138
Not my...

852
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:35,145
Mm.

853
00:38:35,261 --> 00:38:38,705
I'm no expert on L.A.
street art, but it's funny...

854
00:38:38,811 --> 00:38:41,948
this piece seems a lot
more authentic to me now.

855
00:38:47,583 --> 00:38:50,118
I think I'll keep it.

856
00:38:57,176 --> 00:39:00,308
We're here live at the
location of the impromptu shrine

857
00:39:00,343 --> 00:39:04,727
for Paola Cortez, the young art school
student killed at the fashion show

858
00:39:04,762 --> 00:39:06,842
for artist/designer Benny Choi,

859
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:08,456
who has been arrested for the killing.

860
00:39:08,491 --> 00:39:10,430
Can we start, please? Excuse me.

861
00:39:10,465 --> 00:39:11,583
Yes, ma'am.

862
00:39:11,618 --> 00:39:12,916
Thank you.

863
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,152
The mother...

864
00:39:14,233 --> 00:39:17,154
of Paola Cortez can rest
a little easier tonight,

865
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:21,124
knowing that her daughter's
killer is behind bars.

866
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:24,281
The arrest of Benny Choi and
several of the Latin Kings membership

867
00:39:24,371 --> 00:39:27,867
is a reminder that my LAPD

868
00:39:27,902 --> 00:39:30,622
means justice for all.

869
00:39:33,014 --> 00:39:36,029
You know, I'd love to make
that woman cry for real.

870
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,170
She's gonna be chief of
police because of you.

871
00:39:38,205 --> 00:39:39,506
Mm.

872
00:39:39,611 --> 00:39:40,951
I don't know how you do it.

873
00:39:40,986 --> 00:39:42,861
I simply made good on a favor.

874
00:39:42,896 --> 00:39:44,788
- Aren't you the little saint?
- Oh, no, no.

875
00:39:44,823 --> 00:39:47,221
This time, I called in my IOU.

876
00:39:47,293 --> 00:39:50,921
Olivia got what she wanted,
and I got what I wanted.

877
00:39:50,994 --> 00:39:52,780
Oh, don't say it. Come on, don't say it.

878
00:39:52,815 --> 00:39:56,962
I am now an official civilian
consultant for the LAPD.

879
00:39:57,038 --> 00:39:59,262
- Oh.
- Not that there's anything civil

880
00:39:59,297 --> 00:40:00,009
about the Devil.

881
00:40:00,044 --> 00:40:01,856
What fun would that be?

882
00:40:04,019 --> 00:40:04,965
Okay, then.

883
00:40:05,024 --> 00:40:06,167
You win.

884
00:40:06,202 --> 00:40:07,297
We're partners.

885
00:40:07,398 --> 00:40:09,005
What, you're not going to protest?

886
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,623
Actually, no.

887
00:40:09,658 --> 00:40:13,094
I may have no idea what
your angle is, but...

888
00:40:13,345 --> 00:40:15,587
at least now I can keep my eye on you.

889
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:16,915
Keep your enemies close, right?

890
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:18,259
Close?

891
00:40:18,294 --> 00:40:20,675
So does this mean you're gonna take me home

892
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,796
and consummate our new
arrangement, then, Detective?

893
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,483
Oh.

894
00:40:31,575 --> 00:40:34,103
I'll take that as a yes.

895
00:40:41,033 --> 00:40:42,364
Seriously?

896
00:40:42,494 --> 00:40:43,573
What, you're just gonna leave me here?

897
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:44,881
In this part of town?

898
00:40:44,996 --> 00:40:46,606
You said you wanted danger.

899
00:40:46,641 --> 00:40:47,244
What...?

900
00:40:47,805 --> 00:40:50,557
Detective! Detective!

901
00:40:52,672 --> 00:40:54,807
I don't even have a phone!

902
00:40:56,168 --> 00:40:57,209
Ah, well.

903
00:40:57,244 --> 00:40:59,289
That's just marvelous, isn't it?

904
00:41:12,156 --> 00:41:13,482
Humanity tested,

905
00:41:13,558 --> 00:41:14,771
homicide solved,

906
00:41:14,841 --> 00:41:16,872
gangbanger attire dissected...

907
00:41:16,966 --> 00:41:19,551
Although, that one I
still have questions about.

908
00:41:19,623 --> 00:41:20,844
Anyway, cheers.

909
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:25,315
To you, Maze, for saving my mortalized ass.

910
00:41:25,715 --> 00:41:27,349
Cheers.

911
00:41:29,645 --> 00:41:32,827
Yes, you may have a point about
the dangers of becoming mortal.

912
00:41:32,862 --> 00:41:34,428
There are consequences.

913
00:41:34,463 --> 00:41:35,908
I need to be careful.

914
00:41:35,943 --> 00:41:37,394
Yes, you do.

915
00:41:37,531 --> 00:41:39,896
Yes, after all, I almost
got our pet detective killed.

916
00:41:42,676 --> 00:41:44,946
Oh, Mazie...

917
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:48,433
I know that you'll always protect me.

918
00:41:48,567 --> 00:41:52,344
No matter how mortal I become,
the Devil can depend on that.

919
00:41:52,465 --> 00:41:54,600
Yes, you can.

920
00:41:55,348 --> 00:41:57,651
Whatever the danger,
I'll be there to stop it.

921
00:41:58,931 --> 00:42:01,298
Whether you see it coming or not.

922
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:03,567
That's my Maze.

923
00:42:04,018 --> 00:42:05,456
Okay.

924
00:42:50,655 --> 00:42:51,463
Hello?

925
00:42:54,709 --> 00:42:55,639
Hello?

<i>Previously on Lucifer.</i>

00:00:02,703 --> 00:00:04,369
Lucifer Morningstar..

3
00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:06,371
Is that a stage name or something?

4
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:08,206
God-given, I'm afraid.

5
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:09,541
Your return to the Underworld

6
00:00:09,608 --> 00:00:11,042
has been requested.

7
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,011
Remind Dad that I quit Hell

8
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:15,480
because I was sick and tired
of playing a part in his play.

9
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:17,582
Oh, don't say it. Come on, don't say it.

10
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:21,619
I'm now an official
civilian consultant for the LAPD.

11
00:00:21,687 --> 00:00:23,154
I want what's best for Lucifer.

12
00:00:23,222 --> 00:00:25,123
Then give me something
that I can use against Lucifer,

13
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:27,271
and I'll make sure you're
both back where you belong.

14
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:28,927
He doesn't confide in me anymore.

15
00:00:28,994 --> 00:00:32,597
But there is someone he
does talk to... a doctor.

16
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:33,865
Hello there, neighbor.

17
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:37,535
I actually need someone to
confide in about a patient.

18
00:00:37,603 --> 00:00:39,370
And hey, listen, if
you have any patients

19
00:00:39,438 --> 00:00:41,906
- you need to talk about...
- You have no idea.

20
00:00:41,974 --> 00:00:43,575
Just shoot me, Detective, please,

21
00:00:43,642 --> 00:00:45,510
because maybe you'll finally realize...

22
00:00:46,912 --> 00:00:47,612
You're bleeding.

23
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,514
What's happening to me?

24
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:52,417
You're changing, becoming vulnerable.

25
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:54,018
Maybe even...  mortal.

26
00:00:54,086 --> 00:00:56,921
Oh, Mazie. I know that you'll
always protect me.

27
00:00:56,989 --> 00:01:00,792
No matter how mortal I
become, the Devil can depend on that.

28
00:01:02,964 --> 00:01:05,940
_

29
00:01:06,215 --> 00:01:10,523
_

30
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:13,950
_

31
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:32,857
 Oh, sinner man, where
you gonna run to? 

32
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:38,296
 Sinner man, where
you gonna run to? 

33
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:42,867
 Where you gonna run
to, all along them days? 

34
00:01:42,935 --> 00:01:44,536
 Well, I run to the rock 

35
00:01:44,603 --> 00:01:47,805
 Please hide me,
I run to the rock 

36
00:01:47,873 --> 00:01:50,975
 Please hide me,
I run to the rock 

37
00:01:51,043 --> 00:01:56,581
 Please hide me, all
along them days 

38
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:59,450
 But the rock cried
out, "I can't hide you" 

39
00:01:59,518 --> 00:02:00,818
 The rock cried out...

40
00:02:00,886 --> 00:02:02,320
Where you got this one going to?

41
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:04,355
San Diego.

42
00:02:04,423 --> 00:02:06,457
Who gave that order?

43
00:02:06,525 --> 00:02:09,594
 All along them days 

44
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:11,996
 So I ran to the Devil 

45
00:02:12,064 --> 00:02:15,433
 He was waitin', I
ran to the Devil 

46
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:16,701
 He was waitin' 

47
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,636
 I ran to the Devil 

48
00:02:18,704 --> 00:02:20,638
 He was waitin' 

49
00:02:20,706 --> 00:02:22,140
 All along them days 

50
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:25,777
 And I cried, "Power..." 

51
00:02:25,844 --> 00:02:28,846
Yeah, yeah, Pete. Erwin here, 413.

52
00:02:28,914 --> 00:02:32,350
I got a guy bringing down
the Morningstar thing here.

53
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:33,618
 Lord 

54
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:38,723
 Bring down the power, Lord 

55
00:02:43,128 --> 00:02:46,264
 Bring down... 

56
00:02:50,536 --> 00:02:52,536
Erwin,
what's going on? Are you okay?

57
00:02:53,272 --> 00:02:58,209
 Power... to... the... 

58
00:02:58,277 --> 00:03:01,613
 Lord...! 

59
00:03:15,127 --> 00:03:19,530
What made you
think you'd get away with it?

60
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:22,800
If you come clean
now, I'll go easy on you.

61
00:03:24,803 --> 00:03:27,272
So, tell me...

62
00:03:27,339 --> 00:03:29,240
did you eat...

63
00:03:29,308 --> 00:03:31,409
the chocolate cake?

64
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:34,579
No, Mommy.

65
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:38,016
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,385
It's just cake, Chloe.

67
00:03:40,452 --> 00:03:42,620
Cake is so not the point, Dan.

68
00:03:42,688 --> 00:03:44,422
This is about honesty

69
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,157
and personal responsibility.

70
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:48,092
Fine.

71
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,530
I got this.

72
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:56,334
Hey, Monkey.

73
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,736
Do you remember when we had that talk

74
00:03:58,804 --> 00:04:01,172
and we said that
lying is a really bad thing?

75
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,573
Well,

76
00:04:02,641 --> 00:04:04,442
some of your birthday cake is missing.

77
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,577
Now, I didn't eat it,

78
00:04:06,645 --> 00:04:09,714
and we know Mommy didn't eat it, so...

79
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:11,342
is there something you want to tell us?

80
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,554
I ate it.

81
00:04:17,356 --> 00:04:18,356
Mm-hmm.

82
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,458
But Lucifer said it was okay.

83
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:22,226
Oh, really?

84
00:04:23,608 --> 00:04:24,940
He said, if you really want

85
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:28,099
to do something, you should.

86
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:31,269
And I really wanted to
eat some chocolate cake.

87
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:33,504
Huh. That's...

88
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:36,074
interesting.

89
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,244
Why don't you go grab your stuff.

90
00:04:43,615 --> 00:04:46,451
Oh, I am so glad to
hear advice from Lucifer

91
00:04:46,518 --> 00:04:48,619
is on the personal responsibility
lesson plan.

92
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:49,620
Dan, it's not what you think.

93
00:04:49,688 --> 00:04:50,722
You know what, Chloe?

94
00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:52,123
Your private life is
none of my business,

95
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:53,858
but when it comes to Trixie...

96
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:54,926
keep Lucifer out of it.

97
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,130
Decker.

98
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:01,899
Yeah, yeah. I'll hold.

99
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:04,969
Okay, just don't forget
tomorrow night's Taco Tuesday, okay?

100
00:05:05,037 --> 00:05:07,105
- I can't do it.
- Why?

101
00:05:07,172 --> 00:05:08,639
I'm working a stakeout in Van Nuys.

102
00:05:08,707 --> 00:05:11,109
We agreed on planned
family time so that Trixie

103
00:05:11,176 --> 00:05:13,378
can maintain some
normalcy during the separation.

104
00:05:13,445 --> 00:05:15,646
I know, but... this is important.

105
00:05:15,714 --> 00:05:17,415
I thought you wanted to work things out.

106
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,950
I don't have a choice,
Chloe. This is work.

107
00:05:19,017 --> 00:05:20,418
Yeah, I've never heard that one before.

108
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,719
Yeah.

109
00:05:21,787 --> 00:05:23,588
Long Beach?

110
00:05:23,655 --> 00:05:25,323
Okay, I got it.

111
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:26,958
Thanks.

112
00:05:27,893 --> 00:05:29,093
You know,

113
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:31,662
when Trixie asks where you are tomorrow,

114
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,866
I'll be sure to tell her
that something important came up.

115
00:05:36,802 --> 00:05:40,471
Oh, Lucifer.
I brought the after...

116
00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:42,540
after party.

117
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:45,476
Meet Brittany...

118
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:47,478
and Brittany.

119
00:05:47,546 --> 00:05:48,546
Wow.

120
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,047
Hello, Brittanies.

121
00:05:51,116 --> 00:05:53,117
Yes, very nice to meet you.

122
00:05:54,052 --> 00:05:56,354
- Hello.
- Hello.

123
00:05:57,389 --> 00:05:59,323
Shall we move the party upstairs?

124
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:01,526
I'll need my
clothes on, actually.

125
00:06:01,593 --> 00:06:03,628
Sorry, girls. I'm late.

126
00:06:03,695 --> 00:06:04,762
For what?

127
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,897
- Work.
- Please don't tell me

128
00:06:05,964 --> 00:06:07,565
you actually believe you work

129
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:10,168
- for the police.
- Work for, work with.

130
00:06:10,235 --> 00:06:11,569
I'm a civilian consultant.

131
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:13,571
The detective called.
There's been a murder.

132
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,772
My services are needed.

133
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,007
Brittanies...

134
00:06:16,074 --> 00:06:19,177
why don't you make my friend
feel better, hmm?

135
00:06:37,429 --> 00:06:39,230
And, uh, this
bruising is from what?

136
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:40,364
Possible imprint.

137
00:06:40,432 --> 00:06:42,032
I'll know more once I'm back at the lab.

138
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:43,968
Okay. Call me when
you get something.

139
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:45,970
Howdy, partner.

140
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:47,805
We're not partners.

141
00:06:47,873 --> 00:06:49,907
Right.

142
00:06:49,975 --> 00:06:52,176
So, what unpleasantness

143
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:54,846
felled this heap of unrealized
ambition then?

144
00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:56,981
Suffocation, a crushed trachea.

145
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:59,283
And this heap has a name.

146
00:06:59,351 --> 00:07:02,186
Erwin Scovell, 55. He
worked security here for 20 years.

147
00:07:02,254 --> 00:07:03,521
Ooh, talk about suffocating.

148
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,589
Vice suspects this place

149
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,290
has been used by criminal organizations

150
00:07:06,358 --> 00:07:07,992
to store illegal contraband.

151
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,327
Container went missing,

152
00:07:09,394 --> 00:07:12,396
so Scovell probably walked
in on a robbery in progress.

153
00:07:12,464 --> 00:07:15,533
Security cameras were
disabled, so no video.

154
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,502
Probably gonna need to canvass the...

155
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,204
Lucifer, it's a dead body.

156
00:07:20,272 --> 00:07:21,472
A little respect.

157
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:24,275
Do you know, I am amazed
by the deferential regard

158
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:25,743
you people hold for rotting flesh.

159
00:07:25,811 --> 00:07:28,579
I mean, this poor
sap's either already in Hell

160
00:07:28,647 --> 00:07:31,182
or in the Silver City
enduring Uriel's welcome speech,

161
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,384
which is far worse
than Hell, if you ask me.

162
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:35,653
Let's pretend for one
second that you're someone else.

163
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,755
Someone nice, someone mature.

164
00:07:37,823 --> 00:07:39,690
Ooh, I love role-play.

165
00:07:39,758 --> 00:07:40,658
Great.

166
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,193
So, since we don't have any leads,

167
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:44,495
let's focus on the next
steps of the investigation,

168
00:07:44,563 --> 00:07:46,297
like what was in the stolen container.

169
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:48,866
But I've already solved
it. I know what killed Erwin.

170
00:07:48,934 --> 00:07:50,201
What?

171
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:51,402
Boredom.

172
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,870
I mean, getting murdered is probably

173
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:55,273
the most exciting thing that
ever happened to him.

174
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,975
When do we get to raid a
drug house or shoot someone?

175
00:07:58,043 --> 00:08:00,545
I mean, I gave up an
epic foursome to be here.

176
00:08:00,612 --> 00:08:03,614
A man died, and we're going to
do everything we possibly can

177
00:08:03,682 --> 00:08:04,882
to catch the killer.

178
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,484
Pass.

179
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:08,019
Are you joking?

180
00:08:08,086 --> 00:08:09,287
Hard pass.

181
00:08:09,354 --> 00:08:11,389
Hey! After all of your manipulations

182
00:08:11,456 --> 00:08:14,025
to get to work with me, you're
really gonna walk away

183
00:08:14,092 --> 00:08:15,612
because you think this case is boring?

184
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,296
Just call me when you've
got a murder with a pulse.

185
00:08:18,363 --> 00:08:20,898
Or at least someone good-looking.

186
00:08:20,966 --> 00:08:22,900
I mean...

187
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:26,037
Is the Brittany buffet still serving?

188
00:08:26,104 --> 00:08:28,005
- Okay, got it.
- Huh?

189
00:08:28,073 --> 00:08:29,840
God, I was hoping for a good shag

190
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:31,108
just as a palate cleanser

191
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:33,344
to wipe the foul taste
of boredom from my mouth.

192
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:34,512
We need to talk.

193
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,913
Well, as long as
it's not the detective's

194
00:08:35,981 --> 00:08:39,183
homicide/robbery
snoozefest at the docks, I'm all ears.

195
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:41,052
You know, I don't know how they do it.

196
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:43,754
40 hours a week, 52
weeks a year, 50 years.

197
00:08:43,822 --> 00:08:46,324
I mean, I didn't leave Hell just
to step into another one.

198
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:49,627
Yeah, well, about that robbery/homicide
snoozefest.

199
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:53,297
The container that's
missing, it was yours.

200
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,200
What container?

201
00:08:56,268 --> 00:08:58,469
The container.

202
00:09:02,288 --> 00:09:08,428

203
00:09:17,694 --> 00:09:19,660
Didn't you hear what I just said?

204
00:09:19,728 --> 00:09:21,228
The container is missing.

205
00:09:21,296 --> 00:09:22,897
I heard you.

206
00:09:22,964 --> 00:09:25,132
Then why aren't we out
there recovering it?

207
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,435
Why fuss? I suppose if somebody wants it

208
00:09:27,502 --> 00:09:29,036
badly enough to steal it,

209
00:09:29,104 --> 00:09:31,305
then perhaps they should have it, then.

210
00:09:31,373 --> 00:09:33,708
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

211
00:09:33,775 --> 00:09:35,309
This doesn't upset you?

212
00:09:35,377 --> 00:09:37,311
I don't know what to tell you, Maze.

213
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:40,214
I guess it's not that
important to me after all.

214
00:09:41,049 --> 00:09:43,351
Well, it's your container...

215
00:09:43,418 --> 00:09:45,453
and your reputation.

216
00:09:46,488 --> 00:09:48,356
What about my reputation?

217
00:09:48,423 --> 00:09:51,425
Well, apparently, it's
okay to steal from you now.

218
00:09:51,493 --> 00:09:52,660
But...

219
00:09:52,728 --> 00:09:55,896
if it doesn't bother
you... doesn't bother me.

220
00:10:06,174 --> 00:10:07,808
We're
canvassing the entire area

221
00:10:07,876 --> 00:10:08,876
for witnesses now, ma'am.

222
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,944
Okay, good. Let's check

223
00:10:10,011 --> 00:10:10,945
with the nearby businesses,

224
00:10:11,012 --> 00:10:11,979
- All right.
- and check the...

225
00:10:12,047 --> 00:10:13,848
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.

226
00:10:13,915 --> 00:10:15,249
What? Have you thought of
all new offensive things

227
00:10:15,317 --> 00:10:16,751
- to say?
- No, I've changed mind.

228
00:10:16,818 --> 00:10:18,753
I've come back to help. Any leads yet?

229
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,688
I need your help like
I need a third boob.

230
00:10:20,756 --> 00:10:21,856
- Mmm!
- Wait.

231
00:10:21,923 --> 00:10:23,724
Don't say a word. Knew it was a mistake

232
00:10:23,792 --> 00:10:25,355
the minute it came out of my mouth.

233
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,361
We're partners, and I'm
offering you my services.

234
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:29,830
I think you need a refresher course

235
00:10:29,898 --> 00:10:31,132
on how partnership works.

236
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:32,900
You left me hanging, remember?

237
00:10:32,968 --> 00:10:34,735
Yes, but now I'm here
because of the robbery.

238
00:10:34,803 --> 00:10:36,270
Robbery? Why?

239
00:10:36,338 --> 00:10:38,239
Because the container that
was stolen was mine.

240
00:10:38,306 --> 00:10:40,975
You somehow left that out before.

241
00:10:41,042 --> 00:10:42,176
Well, I didn't know before.

242
00:10:42,244 --> 00:10:43,511
Maze handles
logistics... storage and such.

243
00:10:43,578 --> 00:10:46,247
And did you know that
this facility was used

244
00:10:46,314 --> 00:10:48,582
- to house illegal contraband?
- No.

245
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,084
But what better place to store my stuff

246
00:10:50,152 --> 00:10:51,419
than somewhere
people hide illicit goods?

247
00:10:51,486 --> 00:10:52,520
Asking the obvious here,

248
00:10:52,587 --> 00:10:54,989
but was your stuff illegal
contraband, too?

249
00:10:55,056 --> 00:10:56,857
Define "illegal."

250
00:10:56,925 --> 00:10:58,526
What was in the container?

251
00:10:58,593 --> 00:11:01,262
- A personal item, insignificant.
- Yeah, but what was in it?

252
00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:02,963
The only thing I
brought with me to Los Angeles.

253
00:11:03,031 --> 00:11:04,198
I know, but you're not
answering the question.

254
00:11:04,266 --> 00:11:06,267
Look, I was storing
some stuff, it was stolen,

255
00:11:06,334 --> 00:11:07,568
the theft sets an awful precedent,

256
00:11:07,636 --> 00:11:09,737
so I'm obliged to make
the person responsible pay.

257
00:11:09,805 --> 00:11:12,406
Now, if you let me help,

258
00:11:12,474 --> 00:11:16,277
I'm certain we can solve
this case quickly.

259
00:11:16,344 --> 00:11:17,812
And I have a lead.

260
00:11:22,827 --> 00:11:23,884
Snow cones?

261
00:11:23,952 --> 00:11:24,952
This is your lead?

262
00:11:24,953 --> 00:11:26,353
We don't have time for this.

263
00:11:26,421 --> 00:11:27,922
We should be working.

264
00:11:27,989 --> 00:11:29,757
- What can I get you?
- Uh, yes.

265
00:11:29,825 --> 00:11:31,292
I'll have two Tropic Wonders

266
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:33,536
and your face smashed into the ground.

267
00:11:33,561 --> 00:11:34,576
What?

268
00:11:36,164 --> 00:11:37,164
What the...?

269
00:11:37,232 --> 00:11:38,432
Lucifer, what are you doing? Stop!

270
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,067
I believe they call this interrogating.

271
00:11:40,135 --> 00:11:41,402
Lucifer, stop!

272
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,870
- He needs to tell me where my stuff is.
- Don't.

273
00:11:42,938 --> 00:11:44,618
- I just sell snow cones.
- Lucifer!

274
00:11:44,673 --> 00:11:45,973
This isn't how we do things.

275
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,175
This pathetic sap's real
name is Frankie Costa,

276
00:11:48,243 --> 00:11:50,978
and his real job is
transporting and storing illegal goods.

277
00:11:51,046 --> 00:11:52,980
Maze set up the warehouse through him.

278
00:11:53,048 --> 00:11:55,249
So if someone knew to
rob it, he'd be involved.

279
00:11:56,284 --> 00:11:57,852
I wouldn't steal from my own operation.

280
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,321
That warehouse is off-limits.

281
00:12:00,388 --> 00:12:01,388
Hey, man.

282
00:12:01,456 --> 00:12:03,657
I'm trying to get out
of the storage racket.

283
00:12:03,725 --> 00:12:04,725
Yes, focus, Frankie.

284
00:12:04,726 --> 00:12:05,726
Who took my property?

285
00:12:05,727 --> 00:12:06,760
I don't know.

286
00:12:06,828 --> 00:12:08,662
I'm trying to find out myself.

287
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:09,897
This is bad for business.

288
00:12:09,965 --> 00:12:11,098
And who would know
about the storage service?

289
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:11,932
Who are you?

290
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,767
I'm someone with one of these.

291
00:12:13,835 --> 00:12:14,768
But this guy doesn't have one.

292
00:12:14,836 --> 00:12:16,036
So say if I were to walk away,

293
00:12:16,037 --> 00:12:18,272
he can do whatever he wants to you.

294
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,274
Of if you're not
responsible, you can point us

295
00:12:20,342 --> 00:12:22,409
in the right direction
of someone who is. Cool?

296
00:12:22,477 --> 00:12:23,744
Okay, okay.

297
00:12:23,812 --> 00:12:25,779
Los Diablos.

298
00:12:25,847 --> 00:12:26,981
The biker club?

299
00:12:27,048 --> 00:12:28,315
Yeah.

300
00:12:28,383 --> 00:12:30,484
I run the warehouse, but
they run the docks.

301
00:12:30,552 --> 00:12:33,821
If anything went down, they
would know about it.

302
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:35,222
That's all I know.

303
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,423
I swear.

304
00:12:36,491 --> 00:12:38,158
All right, all right.

305
00:12:38,226 --> 00:12:39,960
Fine.

306
00:12:43,498 --> 00:12:45,232
That was incredible.

307
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,967
It was musical, poetic really.

308
00:12:47,035 --> 00:12:48,702
We were like fish and
chips, salt and pepper.

309
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:49,970
Hipsters and condescension.

310
00:12:50,038 --> 00:12:51,038
Give me one good reason

311
00:12:51,072 --> 00:12:53,240
why I shouldn't arrest you for assault.

312
00:12:53,308 --> 00:12:54,708
Fine, Frankie's a complete scumbag,

313
00:12:54,776 --> 00:12:55,709
and he skimps on the cherry syrup.

314
00:12:55,777 --> 00:12:56,777
So that's two, actually.

315
00:12:56,778 --> 00:12:57,978
Uh, something's going on with you,

316
00:12:58,046 --> 00:12:59,780
and it has to do with that
mysterious container,

317
00:12:59,848 --> 00:13:01,088
so no more games... what's in it?

318
00:13:02,617 --> 00:13:04,051
It was a gift from my father.

319
00:13:04,119 --> 00:13:05,519
That's still not an answer.

320
00:13:05,587 --> 00:13:06,867
I mean, what, was it his memoirs?

321
00:13:06,888 --> 00:13:08,856
Some priceless porn collection?

322
00:13:08,924 --> 00:13:10,024
Look, if we're gonna
work together on this,

323
00:13:10,091 --> 00:13:12,760
you're gonna have
to trust me, all right?

324
00:13:14,362 --> 00:13:16,330
You're right, we
shouldn't work together on this.

325
00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:19,767
Aren't we being a touch dramatic?

326
00:13:19,834 --> 00:13:21,168
You know, I put up with a lot of crap

327
00:13:21,236 --> 00:13:22,436
to let you in on my cases,

328
00:13:22,504 --> 00:13:24,138
and that's because thus
far you've been honest with me,

329
00:13:24,205 --> 00:13:26,774
but now, for some reason,
you're not telling me the full story.

330
00:13:26,841 --> 00:13:28,075
I'm telling you

331
00:13:28,143 --> 00:13:30,177
everything you need to
know to help find my stuff.

332
00:13:30,245 --> 00:13:32,546
A man was murdered, and all you
can talk about is your property?

333
00:13:32,614 --> 00:13:34,582
Yes, but if we find
it, then you find out

334
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:37,084
who killed the security guard...
it's win-win.

335
00:13:37,152 --> 00:13:39,286
So, please, enlighten me.

336
00:13:39,354 --> 00:13:41,322
Under what rock
will we find Los Diablos?

337
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:43,657
It's a very on-the-nose name,
if you ask me.

338
00:13:43,725 --> 00:13:44,892
We won't find them anywhere.

339
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,860
It's a conflict of interest.

340
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:56,637
Look, Chloe, I told you,
there's nothing I can do about tomorrow.

341
00:13:56,705 --> 00:13:57,938
Truce.

342
00:13:58,006 --> 00:13:59,640
This is a call for Dan the detective.

343
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:00,608
All right?

344
00:14:00,675 --> 00:14:01,675
I need your help.

345
00:14:01,676 --> 00:14:02,676
Okay.

346
00:14:02,677 --> 00:14:03,877
It's about my case.

347
00:14:03,945 --> 00:14:05,179
Homicide at the docks.

348
00:14:05,246 --> 00:14:06,880
Security guard killed during a robbery.

349
00:14:06,948 --> 00:14:08,749
Yeah, that container that was stolen,

350
00:14:08,817 --> 00:14:10,017
it was Lucifer's.

351
00:14:10,085 --> 00:14:13,687
That storage facility was
filled with black market goods.

352
00:14:13,755 --> 00:14:16,323
Yeah, it was.

353
00:14:16,391 --> 00:14:18,425
You think what Lucifer had stored
in there may be illegal.

354
00:14:18,493 --> 00:14:20,694
Whatever is in that
container, he won't tell me.

355
00:14:20,762 --> 00:14:23,897
And for a man who's all
about over-sharing, says a lot,

356
00:14:23,965 --> 00:14:25,205
so I want you to look into him,

357
00:14:25,266 --> 00:14:27,368
try and find out what
he might be hiding.

358
00:14:27,435 --> 00:14:29,536
Absolutely.

359
00:14:39,581 --> 00:14:41,148
LAPD.

360
00:14:41,216 --> 00:14:42,516
Boss is out.

361
00:14:42,584 --> 00:14:43,984
Yes, I know.

362
00:14:47,022 --> 00:14:48,555
What do you want?

363
00:14:48,623 --> 00:14:49,790
I need to see your books.

364
00:14:49,858 --> 00:14:51,692
Without any foreplay?

365
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,427
Your boss has reported an operating loss

366
00:14:53,495 --> 00:14:54,561
for the last five years.

367
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:56,163
So?

368
00:14:56,231 --> 00:14:58,165
So this club is packed every night.

369
00:14:58,233 --> 00:15:00,768
At 20 bucks an
appletini, it doesn't really add up.

370
00:15:03,905 --> 00:15:05,839
You're Chloe's ex, right?

371
00:15:05,907 --> 00:15:08,575
And you're Lucifer's pet on a leash.

372
00:15:08,643 --> 00:15:09,943
Now answer the question.

373
00:15:10,011 --> 00:15:12,413
Well, technically, that
wasn't a question.

374
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,814
Is your divorce final yet?

375
00:15:13,882 --> 00:15:15,182
That's none of your business.

376
00:15:16,317 --> 00:15:17,651
Now, are you gonna show me your records,

377
00:15:17,719 --> 00:15:19,319
or do I need to get a warrant?

378
00:15:19,387 --> 00:15:20,387
We have nothing to hide.

379
00:15:20,388 --> 00:15:21,422
That's great.

380
00:15:21,489 --> 00:15:23,190
I'll be right here.

381
00:15:23,258 --> 00:15:24,725
Mm-hmm.

382
00:15:24,793 --> 00:15:27,094
Actually, the books are in the office.

383
00:15:27,162 --> 00:15:30,798
And there are way too many
of them to carry all by myself.

384
00:15:30,865 --> 00:15:33,801
But if you come out back with me,

385
00:15:33,868 --> 00:15:36,003
I'll let you see whatever you want.

386
00:15:36,071 --> 00:15:38,272
Just the books is fine.

387
00:15:41,543 --> 00:15:43,744
Right this way.

388
00:15:50,785 --> 00:15:53,253
Straight ahead, to the left.

389
00:16:06,643 --> 00:16:09,177
When Chloe told you to
leave, how did that make you feel?

390
00:16:09,245 --> 00:16:10,545
Well, pissed off, of course.

391
00:16:10,613 --> 00:16:13,482
Whatever was stolen from you
must have been very important.

392
00:16:13,549 --> 00:16:14,583
No.

393
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:17,686
Actually, no, it's the
principle at stake here.

394
00:16:17,754 --> 00:16:21,189
I mean, nobody steals from
me and gets away with it.

395
00:16:22,425 --> 00:16:24,726
This loss brings up an
issue that we've been skirting

396
00:16:24,794 --> 00:16:26,328
since we began our work together.

397
00:16:26,395 --> 00:16:28,563
- Right.
- Your identity.

398
00:16:28,631 --> 00:16:30,832
It's
still the Devil, darling.

399
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,903
Yes, but who are you trying
so hard to become?

400
00:16:34,971 --> 00:16:36,171
Nobody.

401
00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:38,573
I'm completely unbecoming.

402
00:16:38,641 --> 00:16:40,909
And yet you keep trying on many
hats to hide your horns.

403
00:16:40,977 --> 00:16:42,878
Playboy, cop, club owner...

404
00:16:42,945 --> 00:16:45,313
Yes, you forgot "master of
all things tongue-related."

405
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:47,382
Speaking of which, shall we?

406
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,583
That's for later.

407
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:51,553
I think we're onto
something very important here.

408
00:16:51,621 --> 00:16:55,390
One of the hardest things we ever do...

409
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:56,792
is learn to be ourselves.

410
00:16:56,859 --> 00:17:00,962
I want you to tell me who you believe...

411
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,865
is the real you.

412
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,171
I...

413
00:17:10,273 --> 00:17:12,774
I am...

414
00:17:12,842 --> 00:17:16,144
second-guessing your
skills as a therapist.

415
00:17:19,348 --> 00:17:20,715
You're feeling judged.

416
00:17:22,118 --> 00:17:23,185
So you're lashing out and judging me.

417
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:24,252
But that's excellent.

418
00:17:24,287 --> 00:17:25,387
It's transference.

419
00:17:25,454 --> 00:17:26,888
Which means you seek my approval.

420
00:17:26,956 --> 00:17:28,690
I seek no one's approval.

421
00:17:30,193 --> 00:17:31,293
And time's up.

422
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,894
Suddenly I'm no
longer in the amorous mood.

423
00:17:32,962 --> 00:17:35,197
Okay, hold on...

424
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:37,332
Hold on, Lucifer.

425
00:17:39,068 --> 00:17:40,735
You think that's a fight.

426
00:17:40,803 --> 00:17:43,405
I think it's progress.

427
00:17:43,472 --> 00:17:47,142
Or maybe I'm just realizing
what a waste of time this is.

428
00:17:55,351 --> 00:17:57,252
I'm glad you came ba...

429
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,354
- Oh.
- Is everything okay?

430
00:17:59,422 --> 00:18:01,356
It's-it's you. Hi.

431
00:18:01,424 --> 00:18:04,559
I'm sorry, it's just, uh, thin walls.

432
00:18:04,627 --> 00:18:05,360
Oh.

433
00:18:05,428 --> 00:18:06,795
Yes, everything's fine.

434
00:18:08,698 --> 00:18:10,966
Uh, please.

435
00:18:11,033 --> 00:18:13,168
Thanks again for
drinks the other night, Linda.

436
00:18:14,237 --> 00:18:15,637
Uh, yeah.

437
00:18:15,705 --> 00:18:17,105
Yes, that was fun.

438
00:18:17,173 --> 00:18:18,974
Yeah.

439
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:22,911
All right, so what kind of parent
names their kid Lucifer?

440
00:18:24,513 --> 00:18:26,281
I'm sorry, I don't mean
to be unprofessional, but...

441
00:18:26,349 --> 00:18:27,849
We're colleagues. Cone of silence.

442
00:18:27,917 --> 00:18:31,186
And I don't believe his
real name is Lucifer.

443
00:18:32,054 --> 00:18:33,889
We talk in metaphors.

444
00:18:33,956 --> 00:18:35,156
Mmm.

445
00:18:35,224 --> 00:18:37,425
Patients with delusions.

446
00:18:37,493 --> 00:18:39,127
They can be really challenging.

447
00:18:39,195 --> 00:18:41,263
Mm, he's actually quite charming.

448
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,266
Yeah, but even Satan disguises himself

449
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,400
as an angel of the light.

450
00:18:45,468 --> 00:18:47,802
2 Corinthians, chapter 11, verse 14.

451
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,838
Ah.

452
00:18:49,906 --> 00:18:51,740
Two years of seminary school

453
00:18:51,807 --> 00:18:55,076
before I decided I wanted to help
people in a different way.

454
00:18:55,144 --> 00:18:57,212
Ah. Interesting.

455
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,949
I thought you seemed... pure.

456
00:19:03,085 --> 00:19:04,653
Listen, you really helped me
with my patient the other day,

457
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,788
and I would love to return the favor.

458
00:19:06,856 --> 00:19:09,357
I know the Bible inside and out,

459
00:19:09,425 --> 00:19:11,660
so if you ever need a consult,

460
00:19:11,727 --> 00:19:13,828
just let me know.

461
00:19:41,157 --> 00:19:42,424
Whoa.

462
00:19:42,491 --> 00:19:44,192
Just
quit defending him, Mom.

463
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,661
You know Dan's never gonna change.

464
00:19:49,065 --> 00:19:50,131
Mm-hmm.

465
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:53,201
What's for dinner, Mommy?

466
00:19:53,269 --> 00:19:55,470
Greens, you little cake monster.

467
00:19:55,538 --> 00:19:57,305
Yeah.

468
00:19:57,373 --> 00:20:00,308
I mean, I don't know why
I even bother telling you.

469
00:20:00,376 --> 00:20:02,610
He's-he's not gonna change, Mom.

470
00:20:02,678 --> 00:20:04,980
You know, Dan's just the way he is,

471
00:20:05,047 --> 00:20:06,481
and I wasn't asking for the world.

472
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:08,450
I just wanted to see a little effort,

473
00:20:08,517 --> 00:20:09,617
and it's probably too late.

474
00:20:09,685 --> 00:20:14,222
Ah, it's pointless to
discuss this with you.

475
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:17,726
Why? Because you always take his side.

476
00:20:19,128 --> 00:20:21,329
Look, Mom, I...

477
00:20:22,098 --> 00:20:23,098
- Daddy!
- Shh!

478
00:20:23,165 --> 00:20:25,633
- Hey, Monkey!
- What are you doing here?

479
00:20:25,701 --> 00:20:28,703
And why are you wearing a pillow?

480
00:20:28,771 --> 00:20:31,072
Well, those are...
that... those are great questions,

481
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,341
and I'm gonna answer both of them later.

482
00:20:33,409 --> 00:20:35,810
But right now, I need
you to do something for me.

483
00:20:35,878 --> 00:20:37,078
What?

484
00:20:37,146 --> 00:20:40,215
Get me some clothes, and
don't tell Mommy that I'm here.

485
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:41,983
I thought you said lying
was a bad thing.

486
00:20:42,051 --> 00:20:46,321
It is, it's terrible, but
this-this is different.

487
00:20:46,389 --> 00:20:47,689
Because we're gonna play a game.

488
00:20:47,757 --> 00:20:50,091
It's called "Sneak
Daddy Out of the House."

489
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,793
That still sounds like a lie.

490
00:20:53,195 --> 00:20:55,563
You know, it's complicated, Monkey.

491
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:58,066
You're just gonna
have to go with it, okay?

492
00:20:58,134 --> 00:20:59,768
What's in it for me?

493
00:20:59,835 --> 00:21:01,436
What do you want?

494
00:21:01,504 --> 00:21:03,505
- Chocolate cake.
- Done.

495
00:21:03,572 --> 00:21:06,808
- For a whole year.
- Absolutely not.

496
00:21:06,876 --> 00:21:08,810
Mommy, I'm thirsty!

497
00:21:08,878 --> 00:21:10,845
Okay, fine.

498
00:21:10,913 --> 00:21:12,614
Done.

499
00:21:12,681 --> 00:21:15,617
Now will you please go
get me some clothes?

500
00:21:23,225 --> 00:21:24,325
What the hell did you do to me?

501
00:21:24,393 --> 00:21:26,628
What do you mean?

502
00:21:26,695 --> 00:21:28,363
One second, I'm standing here,

503
00:21:28,431 --> 00:21:30,331
next second, I'm in my ex's bed naked.

504
00:21:30,399 --> 00:21:32,534
Well, you're welcome.

505
00:21:32,601 --> 00:21:34,202
So,

506
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,837
did it work?

507
00:21:35,905 --> 00:21:36,905
You two have sex?

508
00:21:36,939 --> 00:21:38,139
No.

509
00:21:38,207 --> 00:21:41,042
Why would you think that
putting me in her bed naked

510
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,277
would get us to have sex?

511
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:44,512
- Always works for me.
- And why would

512
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,147
you even want Chloe and I to have sex?

513
00:21:46,215 --> 00:21:48,083
So that you and her will
get back together,

514
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,550
and she'll be out of Lucifer's life.

515
00:21:49,552 --> 00:21:50,885
You're not from around here, are you?

516
00:21:50,953 --> 00:21:53,054
You have no idea.

517
00:21:53,122 --> 00:21:55,242
You can't just smash two
people together like Barbies,

518
00:21:55,257 --> 00:21:56,825
and think that that's gonna fix things.

519
00:21:56,892 --> 00:21:59,094
Relationships, they
take time and effort.

520
00:21:59,161 --> 00:22:01,596
And you got to work at it, like...

521
00:22:01,664 --> 00:22:03,364
it's your job.

522
00:22:03,432 --> 00:22:07,135
Humans are so exhausting.

523
00:22:07,203 --> 00:22:09,370
Here are the books you wanted to see.

524
00:22:09,438 --> 00:22:11,439
Oh, no, we're not through here.

525
00:22:11,507 --> 00:22:13,741
You assaulted a police officer.

526
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:15,810
I'm taking you in.

527
00:22:15,845 --> 00:22:17,112
And what exactly

528
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:19,681
are you going to say happened?

529
00:22:20,816 --> 00:22:21,816
Hmm?

530
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:26,020
That a tiny female bartender

531
00:22:26,088 --> 00:22:27,622
knocked you out,

532
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:29,257
stripped you naked

533
00:22:29,325 --> 00:22:31,659
and put you in your ex's bed?

534
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,250
I can't explain it.

535
00:22:43,305 --> 00:22:44,739
Lux's books are clean.

536
00:22:44,807 --> 00:22:45,974
How is that even possible?

537
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:47,208
I had them run for
discrepancies with receivables.

538
00:22:47,276 --> 00:22:49,043
I looked for hidden payments.

539
00:22:49,111 --> 00:22:50,912
Whatever Lucifer's into,

540
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,347
it's not running through Lux.

541
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:53,781
All right, thanks for trying.

542
00:22:53,849 --> 00:22:56,818
Listen, Chloe...

543
00:22:56,886 --> 00:22:58,486
I want to talk to
you about Taco Tuesday.

544
00:22:58,521 --> 00:23:01,122
Hey, Dan, I got to go.

545
00:23:02,495 --> 00:23:05,260
Next time you secretly
follow someone, don't tailgate them.

546
00:23:05,327 --> 00:23:06,528
Draws a little attention.

547
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:08,096
It's not my fault you
drive like an elderly turtle.

548
00:23:08,164 --> 00:23:09,164
Lucifer...

549
00:23:09,165 --> 00:23:10,231
go home.

550
00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:11,332
Detective...

551
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,400
It sucks not getting what you want.

552
00:23:12,468 --> 00:23:13,635
Now you have to deal with it

553
00:23:13,702 --> 00:23:14,702
like the rest of us.

554
00:23:14,737 --> 00:23:16,938
I'm sorry.

555
00:23:17,006 --> 00:23:18,973
What did you just say?

556
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:21,009
I apologize.

557
00:23:21,076 --> 00:23:22,844
I crossed the line this morning
with Mr. Snow Cone.

558
00:23:22,912 --> 00:23:24,445
It was a mistake.

559
00:23:24,513 --> 00:23:25,647
I realize that now.

560
00:23:25,714 --> 00:23:27,115
Wow.

561
00:23:27,183 --> 00:23:28,249
You must really be desperate.

562
00:23:28,317 --> 00:23:29,784
I prefer determined.

563
00:23:29,852 --> 00:23:31,619
Look, I need your help to find my stuff.

564
00:23:31,687 --> 00:23:34,389
But you have to admit I've
proven myself useful.

565
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:35,523
Despite the methods employed,

566
00:23:35,591 --> 00:23:37,225
Frankie did give us a solid lead.

567
00:23:37,293 --> 00:23:38,793
Insanely wild guess,

568
00:23:38,861 --> 00:23:40,661
but this is where
we'll find some Los Diablos.

569
00:23:40,696 --> 00:23:42,397
There's an imprint on the victim's neck

570
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:45,133
that we found under UV light.

571
00:23:45,201 --> 00:23:47,202
Killer must've worn
some kind of bracelet

572
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:48,937
when he strangled the security guard.

573
00:23:49,004 --> 00:23:50,371
Cross look familiar?

574
00:23:52,841 --> 00:23:53,841
Well, what do you know?

575
00:23:53,909 --> 00:23:55,210
Our suspect awaits.

576
00:23:55,277 --> 00:23:57,412
Shall we?

577
00:24:16,031 --> 00:24:17,165
What happened to the music?

578
00:24:17,233 --> 00:24:18,233
Hey! Come on, man!

579
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,300
What are you doing, man?

580
00:24:19,368 --> 00:24:20,401
What is this? What's going on here?

581
00:24:20,469 --> 00:24:22,036
What's going on with that?

582
00:24:23,305 --> 00:24:24,339
Excuse me!

583
00:24:24,406 --> 00:24:25,406
Pardon the intrusion,

584
00:24:25,474 --> 00:24:27,809
you Village People rejects,

585
00:24:27,876 --> 00:24:30,979
but one of you has stolen something
that belongs to me.

586
00:24:31,046 --> 00:24:34,549
So please identify yourself, so
I can punish you accordingly.

587
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:39,354
Who do you think you are?

588
00:24:50,487 --> 00:24:52,420
I thought we were past you
thinking you're invincible.

589
00:24:52,488 --> 00:24:54,822
I really want to find my stuff.

590
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:56,224
What the hell did you just say?

591
00:24:56,291 --> 00:24:59,327
Hmm? Harry Potter?

592
00:24:59,394 --> 00:25:01,162
There you go.

593
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,763
Mess him up, Renny.

594
00:25:02,831 --> 00:25:04,332
Well, since you're obviously lower

595
00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:06,100
on the human evolutionary chain,

596
00:25:06,168 --> 00:25:08,302
perhaps your hearing hasn't developed
as well as it should,

597
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,804
so I'll repeat myself.

598
00:25:09,872 --> 00:25:11,239
Who...

599
00:25:11,306 --> 00:25:12,306
stole...

600
00:25:12,307 --> 00:25:13,341
my...

601
00:25:13,408 --> 00:25:14,609
property?

602
00:25:16,712 --> 00:25:19,514
Everybody back the hell
off or you're going to jail.

603
00:25:28,624 --> 00:25:29,624
Pardon my boys.

604
00:25:29,691 --> 00:25:30,958
They don't always have the best, uh,

605
00:25:31,026 --> 00:25:33,094
people skills.

606
00:25:33,161 --> 00:25:34,862
Take a breather, Renny.

607
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:35,930
Now!

608
00:25:35,964 --> 00:25:38,699
Be cool.

609
00:25:38,767 --> 00:25:39,867
Hank Cutter.

610
00:25:39,935 --> 00:25:41,836
I'm in charge here.

611
00:25:41,904 --> 00:25:45,106
Oh, a Mrs. Police. How are you?

612
00:25:45,173 --> 00:25:47,441
Why don't we chat in my office, okay?

613
00:25:47,509 --> 00:25:48,509
Follow me.

614
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:51,712
We heard that you control the docks,

615
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,282
and if anything goes
down, Los Diablos are in on it.

616
00:25:54,349 --> 00:25:56,484
Really? We're just a riding club, okay?

617
00:25:56,552 --> 00:26:00,421
Whose members have been
arrested for guns, drugs, murder.

618
00:26:00,489 --> 00:26:02,356
A few bad apples shouldn't paint us all

619
00:26:02,424 --> 00:26:03,904
in a bad light, now should it, ma'am?

620
00:26:03,926 --> 00:26:05,393
But it does paint you as suspects.

621
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,295
Hey, look, just because we
have a reputation as outlaws

622
00:26:07,362 --> 00:26:10,598
doesn't mean we had
anything to do with a murder.

623
00:26:11,934 --> 00:26:13,467
You like being
considered a criminal, don't you?

624
00:26:15,103 --> 00:26:16,904
Yeah, you do.

625
00:26:16,972 --> 00:26:18,506
What else do you want?

626
00:26:23,912 --> 00:26:25,479
To own a clothing line.

627
00:26:25,547 --> 00:26:26,314
Oh.

628
00:26:26,381 --> 00:26:27,448
Clothing line?

629
00:26:27,516 --> 00:26:30,151
I-I did not see that one coming.

630
00:26:30,218 --> 00:26:32,119
Yes, managing bikers
must be so exhausting.

631
00:26:32,187 --> 00:26:34,155
All that brawling and pillaging.

632
00:26:34,222 --> 00:26:35,856
- I'm 54.
- Really?

633
00:26:35,924 --> 00:26:38,192
I'd rather be in my
hammock playing my Stratocaster.

634
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,528
All this motorcycle
riding's enlarged my prostate.

635
00:26:40,596 --> 00:26:42,029
It's unpleasant.

636
00:26:42,097 --> 00:26:43,898
That's an
unfortunate occupational hazard.

637
00:26:43,966 --> 00:26:45,299
Tell me about it.

638
00:26:45,367 --> 00:26:46,534
Look, we've trademarked our name.

639
00:26:46,602 --> 00:26:47,835
We're selling T-shirts and jackets,

640
00:26:47,903 --> 00:26:49,103
and we're gonna re-brand and...

641
00:26:49,137 --> 00:26:50,538
go legit.

642
00:26:50,606 --> 00:26:51,639
"Legit."

643
00:26:51,707 --> 00:26:54,108
There's a lot of money
in the apparel industry.

644
00:26:54,176 --> 00:26:56,611
All the more reason to
keep our noses clean.

645
00:26:56,678 --> 00:26:58,479
See, we used to cover
the docks, not anymore.

646
00:26:58,547 --> 00:27:01,449
I specifically ordered them off-limits.

647
00:27:01,516 --> 00:27:03,156
Maybe someone missed
the re-branding memo.

648
00:27:03,218 --> 00:27:06,354
Killer wore a
bracelet with an iron cross.

649
00:27:06,421 --> 00:27:09,390
Left an imprint on the dead security
guard at the warehouse.

650
00:27:13,195 --> 00:27:16,330
Look, uh, a lot of
bikers wear iron crosses.

651
00:27:16,398 --> 00:27:19,367
Yeah, well, I'm interested in your
guys who have iron crosses.

652
00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:24,105
Hey, look, I've told
you everything I know.

653
00:27:24,172 --> 00:27:25,206
If you have any more questions,

654
00:27:25,273 --> 00:27:26,974
feel free to contact my attorney.

655
00:27:27,042 --> 00:27:27,975
But we're not finished yet.

656
00:27:28,043 --> 00:27:30,344
Yeah, we're done.

657
00:27:30,412 --> 00:27:32,179
Thank you.

658
00:27:37,285 --> 00:27:39,120
But why are we leaving?

659
00:27:39,187 --> 00:27:40,588
He's hiding something.

660
00:27:40,656 --> 00:27:41,489
It's obvious.

661
00:27:41,556 --> 00:27:42,623
We need to force it out of him.

662
00:27:42,691 --> 00:27:44,892
We have this little
thing called due process.

663
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,560
We can't just force
things out of people.

664
00:27:46,595 --> 00:27:48,963
Besides, there's an easier
way to get our bad guy.

665
00:27:51,199 --> 00:27:53,534
You saw the look on
Cutter's face when he saw that photo.

666
00:27:53,602 --> 00:27:55,202
He knows exactly who robbed the docks.

667
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:57,238
He's gonna need to
deal with this immediately.

668
00:27:57,305 --> 00:27:59,573
Or it puts his plan to
re-brand in jeopardy.

669
00:27:59,641 --> 00:28:00,708
Defying his orders...

670
00:28:00,776 --> 00:28:02,376
it's a huge challenge to his authority.

671
00:28:02,444 --> 00:28:04,578
He's not gonna want to deal
with this in public.

672
00:28:04,646 --> 00:28:06,013
Bet you the first person he goes to see

673
00:28:06,081 --> 00:28:07,381
is the owner of that bracelet.

674
00:28:07,449 --> 00:28:09,950
What, so your strategy is
just to sit here, paralyzed,

675
00:28:10,018 --> 00:28:12,553
hoping that Cutter leads
us to the suspect?

676
00:28:12,621 --> 00:28:13,854
What a terrible idea.

677
00:28:13,922 --> 00:28:15,423
Hmm, you think so?

678
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:16,957
I do, I mean, for one,

679
00:28:17,025 --> 00:28:18,292
even though Cutter's no brain surgeon,

680
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,694
surely he wouldn't just...

681
00:28:19,761 --> 00:28:20,861
Wouldn't what?

682
00:28:27,502 --> 00:28:29,136
Well done, Detective.

683
00:28:34,443 --> 00:28:36,544
A toast to Dr. Linda Martin,

684
00:28:36,611 --> 00:28:38,612
therapist to the Devil himself.

685
00:28:39,981 --> 00:28:42,249
I should put that on the door.

686
00:28:42,317 --> 00:28:44,485
Mm, well, it sounds like he's dealing

687
00:28:44,553 --> 00:28:45,786
with some genuine issues.

688
00:28:45,854 --> 00:28:48,289
I'm just having such a hard
time getting through to him.

689
00:28:48,356 --> 00:28:51,258
Maybe it's because you've
been humoring his metaphor

690
00:28:51,326 --> 00:28:52,693
without fully embracing it.

691
00:28:52,761 --> 00:28:55,529
You mean, completely accept
that he's actually the Devil?

692
00:28:55,597 --> 00:28:57,331
Mm-hmm.

693
00:28:57,399 --> 00:28:59,166
It's worth a try.

694
00:28:59,234 --> 00:29:02,103
If only I knew someone who
could help me with the Bible.

695
00:29:03,472 --> 00:29:06,173
I know so much about it, it's
almost as if I was there.

696
00:29:08,176 --> 00:29:12,213
If he's positioning himself
as the Devil, right?

697
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,014
He must see himself as evil.

698
00:29:14,082 --> 00:29:15,082
Mm!

699
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:15,916
No.

700
00:29:15,984 --> 00:29:17,451
Actually, he's struggling.

701
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:20,488
I think he thinks other
people see him as evil.

702
00:29:20,555 --> 00:29:23,357
You seem attached to this patient.

703
00:29:23,425 --> 00:29:24,892
I am...

704
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,995
very motivated to help him.

705
00:29:28,063 --> 00:29:29,063
I see.

706
00:29:29,064 --> 00:29:30,698
Well, um,

707
00:29:30,766 --> 00:29:32,933
every culture in the world

708
00:29:33,001 --> 00:29:35,636
and throughout history, for that matter,

709
00:29:35,704 --> 00:29:37,538
has its very own myth of the Devil.

710
00:29:37,606 --> 00:29:38,939
Mm-hmm.

711
00:29:39,007 --> 00:29:41,142
But the one thing that
they all have in common

712
00:29:41,209 --> 00:29:44,545
is that the Devil is essentially
a rebellious son.

713
00:29:44,613 --> 00:29:45,780
Sounds like my guy.

714
00:29:45,847 --> 00:29:47,181
I thought it might.

715
00:29:47,249 --> 00:29:48,582
Now, if you're really serious

716
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,130
about embracing the metaphor, Linda...

717
00:29:50,152 --> 00:29:53,287
truly embracing it... I
know how you can get to him.

718
00:29:53,355 --> 00:29:55,556
But he might not
like what you have to say.

719
00:29:55,624 --> 00:29:56,957
But will it help him?

720
00:29:57,025 --> 00:30:00,294
He may not realize it, but yes.

721
00:30:00,362 --> 00:30:01,562
Then let's do it.

722
00:30:14,223 --> 00:30:16,898
I've sat in a parked
car and not had sex.

723
00:30:16,965 --> 00:30:18,966
Ew.

724
00:30:21,637 --> 00:30:23,338
You can't enjoy this.

725
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:24,706
This sitting around endlessly,

726
00:30:24,773 --> 00:30:27,275
waiting for something to happen.

727
00:30:27,343 --> 00:30:29,477
You know, if sitting
here not being entertained

728
00:30:29,545 --> 00:30:30,812
is so terrible, then maybe it's a sign

729
00:30:30,879 --> 00:30:32,039
you should be somewhere else.

730
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:33,748
Have I done something to offend you?

731
00:30:33,816 --> 00:30:36,484
Only every time I see you.

732
00:30:36,552 --> 00:30:38,586
Ha, ha, ha. No, this is different.

733
00:30:41,657 --> 00:30:43,591
For the first time, I
don't think you're being

734
00:30:43,659 --> 00:30:44,892
honest with me. You have this

735
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,494
mysterious container that was stolen

736
00:30:46,562 --> 00:30:48,596
that someone was willing to kill for.

737
00:30:48,664 --> 00:30:51,232
You make shady deals with shady people.

738
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,700
You're violent.

739
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:56,404
Your personal records only go
back five years, and the books

740
00:30:56,472 --> 00:30:57,572
from Lux are way too clean.

741
00:30:57,639 --> 00:30:58,873
It's...

742
00:30:58,941 --> 00:31:00,608
I had Dan go and check it out.

743
00:31:00,676 --> 00:31:02,977
You had Dan deal with Maze alone?

744
00:31:03,045 --> 00:31:04,245
Oh, dear. For the first time,

745
00:31:04,313 --> 00:31:06,748
I actually feel
sorry for Detective Douche.

746
00:31:06,815 --> 00:31:09,016
It all points to you being a criminal.

747
00:31:09,084 --> 00:31:11,486
So what's the big deal?
What if I am a criminal?

748
00:31:11,553 --> 00:31:12,754
I'd have to arrest you.

749
00:31:12,821 --> 00:31:14,122
Ooh, whip out the
cuffs, then. Why shy away

750
00:31:14,189 --> 00:31:15,890
from a little bondage fun?

751
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:17,925
You know, Lucifer, this is serious.

752
00:31:17,993 --> 00:31:19,360
And despite all your weirdness

753
00:31:19,428 --> 00:31:21,629
I...

754
00:31:21,697 --> 00:31:24,165
I actually really like working with you.

755
00:31:28,537 --> 00:31:30,138
So, anyhow...

756
00:31:30,205 --> 00:31:31,439
What a momentous

757
00:31:31,507 --> 00:31:34,509
revelation, Detective
Decker. We should celebrate.

758
00:31:34,576 --> 00:31:36,077
You can celebrate from jail

759
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:38,479
when it turns out I'm right about you.

760
00:31:38,547 --> 00:31:40,248
I have never lied to you.

761
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,649
And I will

762
00:31:41,717 --> 00:31:43,885
never lie to you.

763
00:31:45,521 --> 00:31:47,155
What was in the container?

764
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,261
Russian dolls.

765
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,163
Russian dolls?

766
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,673
Here we go.

767
00:32:09,445 --> 00:32:10,445
Oh, I knew it was

768
00:32:10,479 --> 00:32:11,679
gonna be that Renny guy.

769
00:32:11,747 --> 00:32:13,047
About that warehouse...!

770
00:32:14,917 --> 00:32:16,284
Think I won't?

771
00:32:18,454 --> 00:32:19,754
This is Unit 831.

772
00:32:19,822 --> 00:32:23,691
Shots fired at 21st and Lewis.
We need backup and an ambo, now.

773
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:25,593
Unit 831,

774
00:32:25,661 --> 00:32:27,762
all units in the vicinity...

775
00:33:27,456 --> 00:33:28,723
There.

776
00:33:46,308 --> 00:33:47,508
Bloody mortality.

777
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:01,789
Been a while since I had a good hunt.

778
00:34:06,929 --> 00:34:09,564
That tingling sensation

779
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:11,532
running up your spine... inevitability.

780
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,035
And the bit running down your leg?

781
00:34:14,102 --> 00:34:15,436
Fear.

782
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:44,765
Now...

783
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:48,302
you give me what is mine.

784
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:51,038
Wasn't my idea, I swear.

785
00:34:52,908 --> 00:34:54,628
He didn't tell me what
was in the container.

786
00:34:56,378 --> 00:34:58,579
But I looked.

787
00:35:00,248 --> 00:35:01,248
I saw them.

788
00:35:01,249 --> 00:35:03,884
Who stole them?

789
00:35:03,952 --> 00:35:06,053
Oh, God...

790
00:35:07,255 --> 00:35:08,556
Oh, God...

791
00:35:08,624 --> 00:35:11,158
Who... stole them?

792
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,195
They were yours.

793
00:35:14,262 --> 00:35:17,031
Who stole them?

794
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:18,566
I'm sorry.

795
00:35:18,634 --> 00:35:20,768
I'm so sorry.

796
00:35:20,836 --> 00:35:21,602
Oh...

797
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,704
you are gonna more than sorry

798
00:35:23,772 --> 00:35:26,307
unless you tell me everything.

799
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:27,441
Please. Please, don't...

800
00:35:27,509 --> 00:35:28,909
No!

801
00:35:28,977 --> 00:35:30,177
No! No!

802
00:35:30,245 --> 00:35:31,379
No, don't!

803
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:42,590
I couldn't stop him.

804
00:35:58,548 --> 00:36:00,348
Hey, you all right?

805
00:36:02,085 --> 00:36:03,819
Looks like Cutter's gonna make it.

806
00:36:03,887 --> 00:36:05,788
He just gave a statement.

807
00:36:05,855 --> 00:36:07,056
Cutter?

808
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,023
The guy Renny shot.

809
00:36:08,091 --> 00:36:09,725
Renny was pissed about the direction.

810
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:11,627
Of the club, he
thought they were selling out.

811
00:36:11,695 --> 00:36:12,895
So he went out on his own,

812
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:15,564
robbed the warehouse and
killed the security guard.

813
00:36:17,434 --> 00:36:18,500
We got justice

814
00:36:18,568 --> 00:36:20,569
- for Erwin Scovell.
- Wonderful.

815
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:24,106
And they've recovered one container

816
00:36:24,174 --> 00:36:25,574
belonging to...

817
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:27,109
a Lucifer Morningstar.

818
00:36:27,177 --> 00:36:28,177
Where?

819
00:36:28,178 --> 00:36:29,378
Inside.

820
00:36:29,446 --> 00:36:31,326
You didn't take a sneaky
peek before telling me?

821
00:36:31,381 --> 00:36:34,116
You'd never lie to me, right?

822
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:37,953
You're gonna watch me open it.

823
00:36:41,024 --> 00:36:43,358
You're damn right.

824
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,030
Wow.

825
00:37:26,002 --> 00:37:27,669
Hmm...

826
00:37:31,474 --> 00:37:32,941
I told you.

827
00:37:42,652 --> 00:37:44,686
Why go to all this trouble for dolls?

828
00:37:44,754 --> 00:37:46,088
Oh, come now, Detective.

829
00:37:46,156 --> 00:37:48,824
I have to keep some
mysteries for myself.

830
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:55,864
Enjoy your dolls.

831
00:38:24,994 --> 00:38:27,663
They're gone.

832
00:38:42,245 --> 00:38:43,245
Want to grab that?

833
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,116
Hi, Daddy.

834
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,484
Hey, Monkey.

835
00:38:49,552 --> 00:38:53,856
This is for after dinner, okay?

836
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:58,293
- Hey.
- Hey.

837
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:00,662
Thought you had an important work thing.

838
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:02,598
Well, it wasn't as important

839
00:39:02,665 --> 00:39:04,967
as having tacos with Trixie.

840
00:39:05,034 --> 00:39:06,034
And you.

841
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,872
That is, if it's not too late.

842
00:39:09,939 --> 00:39:11,206
Yeah.

843
00:39:11,274 --> 00:39:13,375
We're just making the salsa.

844
00:39:13,443 --> 00:39:15,277
Great.

845
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:18,847
That smells so yummy.

846
00:39:18,915 --> 00:39:19,815
Oh, good.

847
00:39:19,883 --> 00:39:22,084
I'm glad you came back.

848
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:23,919
Well, I needed to
get my parking validated.

849
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,256
So your items were never recovered?

850
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,323
No.

851
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,358
Earlier, you said

852
00:39:29,425 --> 00:39:32,628
that the items weren't that important.

853
00:39:32,695 --> 00:39:36,164
Yet now, you seem very
upset that they're gone.

854
00:39:36,232 --> 00:39:37,432
Well, I'm a walking paradox.

855
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,102
What can I say?

856
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,770
Sometimes we need to lose something

857
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:44,706
before we can understand its value.

858
00:39:44,774 --> 00:39:46,408
I didn't lose anything.

859
00:39:46,476 --> 00:39:47,476
No.

860
00:39:47,477 --> 00:39:48,797
No, you were a victim of a crime.

861
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:52,414
It's only natural that
you would feel violated.

862
00:39:52,482 --> 00:39:53,722
And often, our feelings of loss

863
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,284
connect to how we feel...

864
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,185
about who we are.

865
00:39:57,253 --> 00:39:58,820
Oh, right.

866
00:39:58,888 --> 00:40:00,422
So we're back on that, are we?

867
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:01,957
You want to talk about my identity.

868
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:03,659
Yes, because you're the Devil.

869
00:40:03,726 --> 00:40:04,927
You told me your names.

870
00:40:04,994 --> 00:40:07,162
But you left out a few others.

871
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,430
Abaddon.

872
00:40:08,498 --> 00:40:09,731
Belial.

873
00:40:09,799 --> 00:40:11,099
Prince of Darkness...

874
00:40:11,167 --> 00:40:12,718
Someone's been brushing
up on their Sunday school.

875
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:15,704
Yes. But before you
fell, you were known as Samael.

876
00:40:16,839 --> 00:40:18,307
The Lightbringer.

877
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:20,309
I don't go by that name anymore.

878
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:22,744
That was a name that
connotated your father's love for you.

879
00:40:22,812 --> 00:40:25,314
Right.

880
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:27,482
Was casting his son into Hell

881
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,117
also an expression of his love?

882
00:40:29,185 --> 00:40:30,953
Oh, God didn't cast you out of Heaven

883
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,721
because he was angry with you.

884
00:40:32,789 --> 00:40:35,958
How can you presume to
know God's intentions?

885
00:40:36,025 --> 00:40:37,192
Oh, I don't.

886
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,160
I can't.

887
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,547
Then maybe stick within the limits

888
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:40,629
of your intellectual capacity.

889
00:40:40,697 --> 00:40:42,164
Or maybe my simplicity

890
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,099
offers me a different perspective.

891
00:40:44,167 --> 00:40:45,600
God cast you out

892
00:40:45,668 --> 00:40:47,135
because He needed you

893
00:40:47,203 --> 00:40:49,638
to do the most difficult of jobs.

894
00:40:49,706 --> 00:40:52,507
- It was a gift.
- Gift?

895
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,343
He shunned me.

896
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,610
He vilified me.

897
00:40:55,678 --> 00:40:57,879
He made me a torturer!

898
00:40:59,949 --> 00:41:01,616
Can you even begin to
fathom what it was like?

899
00:41:01,684 --> 00:41:04,786
Eons spent

900
00:41:04,854 --> 00:41:06,521
providing a place for dead mortals

901
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,457
to punish themselves?

902
00:41:08,524 --> 00:41:10,993
I mean, why do they blame me
for all their little failings?

903
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:13,562
As if I'd spent my days sitting
on their shoulder,

904
00:41:13,629 --> 00:41:15,998
forcing them to commit acts they'd
otherwise find repulsive.

905
00:41:16,065 --> 00:41:17,265
"Oh, the Devil made me do it."

906
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,235
I have never made any
one of them do anything.

907
00:41:20,303 --> 00:41:21,303
Never.

908
00:41:21,304 --> 00:41:23,872
What happened to you is unfair.

909
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:24,639
Unfair?

910
00:41:24,707 --> 00:41:26,274
This is unjust.

911
00:41:26,342 --> 00:41:28,977
For all eternity, my
name will be invoked

912
00:41:29,045 --> 00:41:30,812
to represent all their depravity.

913
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,782
That is the gift that my father gave me.

914
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:34,983
It was an act of love.

915
00:41:35,051 --> 00:41:36,084
How do you know?

916
00:41:36,152 --> 00:41:38,553
Because you are his
favorite son, Samael.

917
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,522
Do not call me that, please!

918
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,391
You are his fallen angel.

919
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,458
But here's the thing:

920
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,760
When angels fall,

921
00:41:44,827 --> 00:41:47,262
they also... rise.

922
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:48,497
All you have to do

923
00:41:48,564 --> 00:41:51,533
is embrace all that you are.

924
00:41:51,601 --> 00:41:53,435
I can't.

925
00:41:53,503 --> 00:41:55,103
Yes, you can.

926
00:41:55,171 --> 00:41:57,539
You just have to be
open to the process...

927
00:41:57,607 --> 00:41:59,207
You don't understand.

928
00:41:59,275 --> 00:42:00,942
- I can't!
- But why?

929
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:03,311
Because they stole them from me!

930
00:42:35,278 --> 00:42:38,447
Someone's got them, Mazikeen.

931
00:42:44,587 --> 00:42:47,022
Someone's got my wings.

The container.

5

Your return to the Underworld

Paolucci thinks he took

Oh, God.

19
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:32,972
Who stole them?

20
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,140
They were yours.

21
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:35,575

 The feeling of your skin

 We love for life 

38
00:01:18,452 --> 00:01:21,220
 On and on and on

LUCIFER: Hello, Sergei.

62
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:23,783
Waters a bit rough, are they?

63
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:25,885
What-what the hell are you doing?

64
00:02:25,953 --> 00:02:26,953
Isn't it obvious?

65
00:02:26,987 --> 00:02:28,554
I'm going to brutally torture you

66
00:02:28,622 --> 00:02:29,655
until you give me what I want.

67
00:02:29,723 --> 00:02:31,157
My wings... where are they?

68
00:02:31,225 --> 00:02:33,960
What wings? I don't even
know what you're talking about!

69
00:02:35,028 --> 00:02:36,028
Why do they always

70
00:02:36,063 --> 00:02:38,364
insist on being so difficult?

71
00:02:38,432 --> 00:02:39,999
- (chuckles)
- All right.

72
00:02:40,067 --> 00:02:41,133
(gasps)

73
00:02:41,201 --> 00:02:42,268
As you can see,

74
00:02:42,336 --> 00:02:43,236
I'm not playing,

75
00:02:43,303 --> 00:02:44,303
so let's try again,

76
00:02:44,304 --> 00:02:45,805
shall we?

77
00:02:45,873 --> 00:02:47,473
My wings, please.

78
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,542
Look, man, why would I take your wings?

79
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,277
I don't even know who you are!

80
00:02:51,345 --> 00:02:53,179
I'm Lucifer Morningstar.

81
00:02:53,247 --> 00:02:55,147
And you, you small-peckered fool,

82
00:02:55,215 --> 00:02:57,550
are Sergei Bok, a known smuggler.

83
00:02:57,618 --> 00:02:58,738
You move just about anything

84
00:02:58,785 --> 00:03:00,419
you can get your trashy Euro hands on.

85
00:03:00,487 --> 00:03:01,487
Please, man!

86
00:03:01,522 --> 00:03:02,655
I don't have 'em!

87
00:03:02,723 --> 00:03:03,890
I swear.

88
00:03:03,957 --> 00:03:06,455
Okay? I don't know
what I'd do with a pair...

89
00:03:06,493 --> 00:03:08,427
Maybe if I hit him a few times?

90
00:03:08,495 --> 00:03:10,596
Though I hate to say it,

91
00:03:10,664 --> 00:03:12,932
I'm not sure violence is the trick here.

92
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,600
I'm beginning to wonder

93
00:03:14,668 --> 00:03:16,836
if this human stain is
actually telling the truth.

94
00:03:16,904 --> 00:03:18,337
No! He's scum.

95
00:03:18,405 --> 00:03:19,939
He'll say anything.

96
00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:21,574
Maybe it's not him, it's us.

97
00:03:21,642 --> 00:03:22,742
Us?

98
00:03:22,809 --> 00:03:25,111
He's the fifth man we've
accosted this week.

99
00:03:25,178 --> 00:03:27,079
Perhaps we're... dare I say it...

100
00:03:27,147 --> 00:03:29,115
going about this wrong?

101
00:03:29,182 --> 00:03:30,383
(sighs)

102
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:33,286
It may be time to seek
the help of a professional.

103
00:03:33,353 --> 00:03:34,720
(sighs)

104
00:03:34,788 --> 00:03:36,556
Oh!

105
00:03:36,623 --> 00:03:38,558
Maze!

106
00:03:39,626 --> 00:03:40,793
(gasps)

107
00:03:42,963 --> 00:03:43,963
(coughing)

108
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,034
Hey.

109
00:03:48,101 --> 00:03:49,302
I don't know that you
want to be here right now.

110
00:03:49,369 --> 00:03:50,503
DETECTIVE: There she is.

111
00:03:50,571 --> 00:03:53,139
Yeah. What, do I hate a
"hate me" sign on my face?

112
00:03:53,206 --> 00:03:54,974
If only it were that simple.

113
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:56,742
It's about Malcolm.

114
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:57,810
What about him?

115
00:03:57,878 --> 00:03:59,679
They guy's been in a coma for months.

116
00:03:59,746 --> 00:04:01,847
His wife decided to pull the plug.

117
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,317
Malcolm's dying today,

118
00:04:04,384 --> 00:04:07,253
and you're still
investigating him for corruption.

119
00:04:07,321 --> 00:04:08,601
So, what, they hate me even more

120
00:04:08,622 --> 00:04:09,989
now that I won't put a halo on his head?

121
00:04:10,057 --> 00:04:11,057
Maybe stay away

122
00:04:11,058 --> 00:04:12,692
from the precinct tonight.

123
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,727
Cops are staging a living wake here.

124
00:04:14,795 --> 00:04:15,928
Anything else?

125
00:04:21,301 --> 00:04:23,202
It would make everyone's life easier

126
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,338
if you would close your investigation.

127
00:04:25,405 --> 00:04:26,672
You know, Dan, I
thought we were actually

128
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,374
making progress there for a second,

129
00:04:28,442 --> 00:04:31,718
but once again, look
who's on Team Everyone Else.

130
00:04:32,145 --> 00:04:33,185
I'm trying to protect you.

131
00:04:33,246 --> 00:04:34,313
From what?

132
00:04:34,381 --> 00:04:36,248
Catching a criminal or hurting your rep?

133
00:04:37,417 --> 00:04:38,584
It's not about any of that.

134
00:04:38,652 --> 00:04:39,952
It's about Malcolm's family.

135
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,254
If there's an open
investigation calling for his dismissal,

136
00:04:42,322 --> 00:04:43,522
it can cost them his benefits,

137
00:04:43,557 --> 00:04:44,890
his pension, all of it.

138
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:47,026
So, what, you want me to just drop it?

139
00:04:47,094 --> 00:04:49,795
Just turn my back on
everything I stand for?

140
00:04:49,863 --> 00:04:51,097
No.

141
00:04:51,164 --> 00:04:52,865
I'm saying if you want to
do something about it,

142
00:04:52,933 --> 00:04:53,933
then do it now.

143
00:04:53,934 --> 00:04:56,235
You have 24 hours.

144
00:04:56,303 --> 00:04:58,571
Or let it go and let his family move on.

145
00:05:18,558 --> 00:05:21,397
Is this really what you
do in your spare time?

146
00:05:21,662 --> 00:05:23,729
How fascinatingly morose.

147
00:05:23,797 --> 00:05:25,431
Do you ever think of taking up knitting?

148
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:27,767
What are you doing here?

149
00:05:27,834 --> 00:05:31,270
I'm here because I could
really use your expertise.

150
00:05:31,338 --> 00:05:33,339
You're not busy, are you?

151
00:05:33,407 --> 00:05:34,974
Actually, shocker, I am busy.

152
00:05:35,042 --> 00:05:36,876
And it's really not a good day

153
00:05:36,943 --> 00:05:38,844
for... your... Luciferness.

154
00:05:38,912 --> 00:05:39,979
Hmm?

155
00:05:40,047 --> 00:05:41,280
Here's an idea.

156
00:05:41,348 --> 00:05:42,581
- Call next time.
- No, no, no.

157
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:44,717
Hold on.

158
00:05:44,785 --> 00:05:47,687
Now, I'm not one to get into
the feels, usually, but...

159
00:05:47,754 --> 00:05:49,889
you seem genuinely distressed.

160
00:05:50,957 --> 00:05:51,724
You okay?

161
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:53,125
Do you want to... I don't know...

162
00:05:53,193 --> 00:05:55,394
chat about it or something?

163
00:05:55,462 --> 00:05:57,697
Sex is always on the table.

164
00:05:57,764 --> 00:05:58,597
(scoffs)

165
00:05:58,665 --> 00:05:59,865
You never quit, do you?

166
00:05:59,933 --> 00:06:00,666
(laughs) No.

167
00:06:00,734 --> 00:06:03,469
I'm simply offering an ear.

168
00:06:04,871 --> 00:06:06,272
Come on.

169
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:07,973
(sighs)

170
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:11,477
Remember the Palmetto
case I was telling you about?

171
00:06:11,545 --> 00:06:12,945
The case that's been consuming you,

172
00:06:13,013 --> 00:06:14,013
causing people to despise you,

173
00:06:14,081 --> 00:06:15,448
call you names... I even quarreled

174
00:06:15,515 --> 00:06:17,016
upon occasion because of it?

175
00:06:17,084 --> 00:06:18,751
No, doesn't ring a bell.

176
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:19,985
(chuckles)

177
00:06:20,053 --> 00:06:21,813
Well, they're pressuring
me to drop the case,

178
00:06:21,855 --> 00:06:22,621
assume the party line,

179
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:24,056
and say the guy died a hero.

180
00:06:24,124 --> 00:06:25,324
My spidey sense tells me

181
00:06:25,392 --> 00:06:27,793
dropping it's not what you want, is it?

182
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:29,095
I want the truth.

183
00:06:29,162 --> 00:06:30,162
Well, then seek it out.

184
00:06:30,197 --> 00:06:31,330
You're a police officer.

185
00:06:31,398 --> 00:06:32,965
You don't need anyone's permission.

186
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:34,266
Hmm.

187
00:06:34,334 --> 00:06:36,135
That's decent-ish advice.

188
00:06:36,203 --> 00:06:38,237
I know. I'm quite good.

189
00:06:38,305 --> 00:06:39,605
Anyway, now we've helped you, my turn.

190
00:06:39,673 --> 00:06:42,141
See, I'm working a
sort of case of my own.

191
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:43,476
And it seems that I've...

192
00:06:43,543 --> 00:06:45,611
Well, hit a bit of a snag.

193
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,847
A case?

194
00:06:47,914 --> 00:06:49,014
(chuckles) Um...

195
00:06:49,082 --> 00:06:50,249
What kind of case is it?

196
00:06:50,317 --> 00:06:51,851
Well, the nature of the investigation

197
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:52,918
isn't important.

198
00:06:52,953 --> 00:06:54,854
I'm strictly here for
professional advice.

199
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:58,090
What do you do when
your case hits a wall?

200
00:06:58,158 --> 00:06:59,358
Mmm.

201
00:06:59,426 --> 00:07:00,960
What do I do when I get stuck?

202
00:07:01,027 --> 00:07:02,027
Yes.

203
00:07:02,095 --> 00:07:04,063
Well, I grab a pair of fresh eyes...

204
00:07:04,131 --> 00:07:06,565
someone who's not gonna be
afraid to be honest with me,

205
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:09,535
even if it's not what I want to hear.

206
00:07:09,603 --> 00:07:10,402
Hello.

207
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,605
That's a brilliant idea.

208
00:07:12,672 --> 00:07:13,773
Yeah.

209
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,674
It kinda is.

210
00:07:15,742 --> 00:07:17,109
So...

211
00:07:17,177 --> 00:07:19,211
maybe if you help me,

212
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,713
I could help you.

213
00:07:20,781 --> 00:07:22,181
(door creaking)

214
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:23,482
Could...

215
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,151
And Bob's your uncle.

216
00:07:25,218 --> 00:07:26,352
Right.

217
00:07:37,464 --> 00:07:39,698
What are we doing here, Lucifer?

218
00:07:39,766 --> 00:07:42,067
I like to come here from time to time.

219
00:07:42,135 --> 00:07:43,803
Dip my toes in the sand,

220
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,337
breathe the ocean air,

221
00:07:45,405 --> 00:07:47,339
walk down memory lane.

222
00:07:47,407 --> 00:07:48,574
(chuckles)

223
00:07:49,643 --> 00:07:51,577
You see, five years ago,

224
00:07:51,645 --> 00:07:53,078
when Maze and I abandoned Hell,

225
00:07:53,146 --> 00:07:55,815
I landed right here on this beach.

226
00:07:57,284 --> 00:07:59,251
This is where I flipped dead old Dad

227
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:00,953
the grandest of birds.

228
00:08:02,322 --> 00:08:04,056
And had Maze sever my wings.

229
00:08:04,124 --> 00:08:06,425
And why are you telling me this?

230
00:08:06,493 --> 00:08:07,893
Honestly, why summon me here at all?

231
00:08:07,894 --> 00:08:10,696
Surely it's not just to reminisce.

232
00:08:10,764 --> 00:08:12,264
(chuckles)

233
00:08:13,433 --> 00:08:15,301
I've asked you here because
those same wings

234
00:08:15,368 --> 00:08:17,236
have been stolen.

235
00:08:18,505 --> 00:08:21,640
And I need your help to get them back.

236
00:08:25,995 --> 00:08:32,083
Sync & corrections by <font color="#00ff00">Somnath Yadav</font>
<font color="#ffff00">join me @somnath66/</font>

237
00:08:33,906 --> 00:08:35,521
- Your wings are missing?
- (chuckles)

238
00:08:35,588 --> 00:08:36,588
Sorry, is there an echo?

239
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:37,790
Isn't that what I just said?

240
00:08:37,857 --> 00:08:39,625
What exactly am I
supposed to do with that news?

241
00:08:39,692 --> 00:08:41,226
Use your angelic powers

242
00:08:41,294 --> 00:08:43,362
to soar around the city and find them.

243
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,530
I mean, really,

244
00:08:44,597 --> 00:08:45,697
what good's an angel

245
00:08:45,765 --> 00:08:47,366
if he can't help a brother out?

246
00:08:47,434 --> 00:08:48,967
Am I right?

247
00:08:50,437 --> 00:08:51,904
Lucy,

248
00:08:51,971 --> 00:08:53,411
since your grand departure from Hell,

249
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,941
I've been the one that's
had to patrol the gates,

250
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:57,576
I've been the one keeping damned souls

251
00:08:57,644 --> 00:09:01,180
from slipping loose... a
job, by the way, that I loathe.

252
00:09:01,247 --> 00:09:02,748
- I didn't ask for that.
- But those wings

253
00:09:02,816 --> 00:09:04,883
out there in the human world?

254
00:09:04,951 --> 00:09:06,351
Lucy, they're too powerful.

255
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:07,753
A piece of divinity.

256
00:09:07,821 --> 00:09:10,022
Humanity can't handle them.

257
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,890
And if they fall into the wrong hands...

258
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,559
Then people might die? Yeah, I get that.

259
00:09:13,626 --> 00:09:15,561
Just saw a chap toss
himself off a building

260
00:09:15,628 --> 00:09:18,497
after a mere peek at them, so
if you're done telling me things

261
00:09:18,565 --> 00:09:20,466
I already know...

262
00:09:22,202 --> 00:09:24,736
will you help me or not?

263
00:09:24,804 --> 00:09:26,505
You tell me something.

264
00:09:26,573 --> 00:09:27,806
If you truly hated the wings,

265
00:09:27,874 --> 00:09:29,641
why'd you hold onto them all this time?

266
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:31,810
(chuckles)

267
00:09:31,878 --> 00:09:34,446
- That is none of your business.
- It's a sentimental move, Lucy.

268
00:09:34,514 --> 00:09:36,048
Especially for someone that was trying

269
00:09:36,116 --> 00:09:37,382
to leave their life behind.

270
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,817
Please. Here we go.

271
00:09:38,885 --> 00:09:41,820
Maybe deep down you realize
you never should've cut them off.

272
00:09:41,888 --> 00:09:43,188
And maybe that's why

273
00:09:43,256 --> 00:09:45,090
you left yourself an out.

274
00:09:45,158 --> 00:09:46,625
Yeah.

275
00:09:46,693 --> 00:09:47,926
So are you done?

276
00:09:47,994 --> 00:09:49,962
Pretty words, but no.

277
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:51,964
They're my property. I want them back.

278
00:09:52,031 --> 00:09:53,398
Simple as that. If I can avoid

279
00:09:53,466 --> 00:09:56,435
an earth-shattering
tragedy as well... bonus.

280
00:09:56,503 --> 00:09:58,403
You wanted free will.

281
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,141
You wanted accountability.

282
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,076
Well...

283
00:10:04,144 --> 00:10:06,979
fix your own damn mess, for once.

284
00:10:16,122 --> 00:10:17,489
(chuckles) I've been thinking.

285
00:10:17,557 --> 00:10:19,091
Your problem, my problem...

286
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:22,027
why not be each other's
fresh eyes and all that?

287
00:10:22,095 --> 00:10:23,829
Hey, what do you say, quid pro quo?

288
00:10:23,897 --> 00:10:25,931
Oh, so now you need my help.

289
00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:27,933
Sorry, am I not enunciating today?

290
00:10:28,001 --> 00:10:30,636
Yes, I've come seeking
your very generous aid.

291
00:10:30,703 --> 00:10:32,971
First you have to tell me what
it is you're working on.

292
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,072
(chuckles)

293
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,774
I'm not sure you can handle it.

294
00:10:35,842 --> 00:10:36,842
Try me.

295
00:10:36,876 --> 00:10:38,810
Okay.

296
00:10:38,878 --> 00:10:40,212
Uh, remember that container

297
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,813
that was so inelegantly taken from me?

298
00:10:41,881 --> 00:10:43,081
The one I was convinced

299
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:44,850
- was hiding something?
- Yes, well, it wasn't just

300
00:10:44,918 --> 00:10:46,398
nesting dolls that I was looking for.

301
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:49,788
There was something
else, something... personal

302
00:10:49,856 --> 00:10:51,423
that was missing when we got there.

303
00:10:51,491 --> 00:10:52,624
I knew it.

304
00:10:52,692 --> 00:10:54,893
Lucifer, what was in there?

305
00:10:54,961 --> 00:10:57,563
My angel wings.

306
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,630
(laughs)

307
00:10:58,665 --> 00:10:59,765
(chuckles) Yeah, go on.

308
00:10:59,832 --> 00:11:00,899
Get it all out.

309
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:01,934
(laughing) Okay, seriously,

310
00:11:02,001 --> 00:11:03,368
what was in there?

311
00:11:06,573 --> 00:11:07,973
Oh, you are serious?

312
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,709
Oh... okay, sorry.

313
00:11:10,777 --> 00:11:12,244
Did someone make them for you?

314
00:11:12,312 --> 00:11:15,180
Or are you big into cosplay?

315
00:11:15,248 --> 00:11:16,381
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

316
00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:17,516
Sorry, I'll admit

317
00:11:17,584 --> 00:11:19,318
I don't always get you.

318
00:11:19,385 --> 00:11:21,653
But if this is really that important...

319
00:11:21,721 --> 00:11:23,155
It is.

320
00:11:23,223 --> 00:11:25,090
Okay, I will do what I can.

321
00:11:25,158 --> 00:11:27,993
I will put out an APB on...

322
00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:31,063
angel wings.

323
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,564
Thank you, and in return,

324
00:11:32,632 --> 00:11:35,067
I shall donate my
services on Palmetto, all right?

325
00:11:35,134 --> 00:11:36,254
Sure, we could use the help.

326
00:11:36,302 --> 00:11:38,003
- (door opens)
- "We"?

327
00:11:38,905 --> 00:11:40,205
- Hey.
- Ready to go?

328
00:11:40,273 --> 00:11:42,074
Yeah, you weren't around to help,

329
00:11:42,141 --> 00:11:43,642
so I recruited someone else.

330
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,710
The more, the merrier.

331
00:11:44,744 --> 00:11:45,744
You're helping her?

332
00:11:45,745 --> 00:11:47,913
I knew she wouldn't give it up.

333
00:11:47,981 --> 00:11:49,081
And I couldn't let her go it alone,

334
00:11:49,148 --> 00:11:51,550
so I'm here for the ride.

335
00:11:51,618 --> 00:11:52,784
Hmm.

336
00:11:52,852 --> 00:11:54,019
Cool.

337
00:11:54,087 --> 00:11:55,721
The three of us working together.

338
00:11:55,788 --> 00:11:57,356
Yes, cool.

339
00:11:57,423 --> 00:11:59,057
What could be better?

340
00:12:00,693 --> 00:12:04,096
 Bursting inside 

341
00:12:04,163 --> 00:12:05,897
 It's getting harder to hide... 

342
00:12:05,965 --> 00:12:08,967
So, this is Palmetto Street.

343
00:12:10,503 --> 00:12:12,437
I'm sorry, why is he here again?

344
00:12:12,505 --> 00:12:15,774
Uh, he helps me see things differently.

345
00:12:15,842 --> 00:12:19,411
Yes, I've proved
myself quite useful, Dan.

346
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:21,513
So, how can we help you?

347
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:23,148
All right, I want to
reenact the shooting.

348
00:12:23,216 --> 00:12:24,616
I want to figure out what I missed.

349
00:12:24,617 --> 00:12:25,817
How's that gonna prove anything?

350
00:12:25,885 --> 00:12:28,687
- Just humor me, thanks.
- (chuckles)

351
00:12:28,755 --> 00:12:30,856
- Lucifer?
- Yes?

352
00:12:30,923 --> 00:12:32,424
You will represent the seedy

353
00:12:32,492 --> 00:12:33,825
criminal element.

354
00:12:33,893 --> 00:12:35,827
Oh, I believe you mean handsome
criminal element.

355
00:12:35,895 --> 00:12:37,596
- (Dan scoffs)
- And, Dan,

356
00:12:37,664 --> 00:12:39,698
you will stand for Malcolm.

357
00:12:39,766 --> 00:12:40,766
The tough as nails cop,

358
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:41,933
who wishes I would

359
00:12:42,001 --> 00:12:43,435
leave this stupid case alone.

360
00:12:43,503 --> 00:12:44,870
Ah, cute.

361
00:12:44,937 --> 00:12:46,271
And I will play myself.

362
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:48,907
A chick cannot figure
out what the hell I saw.

363
00:12:48,975 --> 00:12:50,342
So in the months leading
up to the shooting,

364
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:52,277
we were following a
French drug trafficker

365
00:12:52,345 --> 00:12:53,545
Nikolas Aoudi.

366
00:12:53,613 --> 00:12:54,813
Ooh, can I have a gun?

367
00:12:54,881 --> 00:12:56,615
I feel like Nikolas would
definitely have a gun.

368
00:12:56,683 --> 00:12:57,883
No...

369
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,151
Actually he was more of a hammer guy.

370
00:12:59,218 --> 00:13:00,619
Liked to break fingers and arms.

371
00:13:00,687 --> 00:13:02,187
- Okay...
- Some legs and teeth.

372
00:13:02,255 --> 00:13:04,389
Right. Can I have a hammer, then?

373
00:13:04,457 --> 00:13:07,125
Somehow Aoudi kept evading the LAPD.

374
00:13:07,193 --> 00:13:09,313
I arrested one of his
guys, thought he was gonna flip.

375
00:13:09,329 --> 00:13:11,063
Then suddenly he changed his tune.

376
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,265
The only cop who spoke
to him was Malcolm.

377
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,333
So...

378
00:13:14,334 --> 00:13:17,069
one night, I tracked him here,

379
00:13:17,136 --> 00:13:19,237
sneaking in through the side door.

380
00:13:19,305 --> 00:13:22,074
And I hid behind this glass.

381
00:13:22,141 --> 00:13:24,176
I could see them.

382
00:13:24,243 --> 00:13:26,445
<i>It was Malcolm and
Aoudi and his bodyguard.</i>

383
00:13:26,512 --> 00:13:29,047
<i>They, they looked like
they were making a deal.</i>

384
00:13:29,115 --> 00:13:31,249
<i>Malcolm was holding cash.</i>

385
00:13:31,317 --> 00:13:32,584
Hold on.

386
00:13:32,652 --> 00:13:34,653
(grunts) Ooh, is that enough?

387
00:13:34,721 --> 00:13:36,788
CHLOE: A bribe, maybe.

388
00:13:36,856 --> 00:13:38,757
I'm not sure.

389
00:13:38,825 --> 00:13:41,159
<i>But I leaned forward to
hear what they were saying.</i>

390
00:13:41,227 --> 00:13:42,961
<i>- (glass rattles)
- And accidentally,</i>

391
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:44,029
<i>I made a sound.</i>

392
00:13:44,097 --> 00:13:45,097
<i>I-I could feel it.</i>

393
00:13:45,164 --> 00:13:46,932
<i>He saw me, but he didn't react.</i>

394
00:13:46,999 --> 00:13:49,234
<i>He just went back to his conversation.</i>

395
00:13:49,302 --> 00:13:50,662
<i>And that's when the shot went off.</i>

396
00:13:50,703 --> 00:13:52,137
(gunshots)

397
00:13:52,205 --> 00:13:53,872
<i>It didn't take long before bullets
were flying everywhere.</i>

398
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,241
<i>I braced behind the door,</i>

399
00:13:56,309 --> 00:13:58,610
<i>and that's when I ran in.</i>

400
00:13:58,678 --> 00:14:00,912
<i>Aoudi and his man were dead.</i>

401
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,782
<i>Malcolm was on the floor, bleeding out.</i>

402
00:14:06,953 --> 00:14:08,820
There was nothing you could do.

403
00:14:14,093 --> 00:14:15,927
It doesn't make sense.

404
00:14:15,995 --> 00:14:17,028
Excuse me?

405
00:14:17,096 --> 00:14:18,530
Aoudi would have no
desire to kill Malcolm.

406
00:14:18,598 --> 00:14:21,299
Trust me, if there's one
thing I know, it's desire.

407
00:14:21,367 --> 00:14:24,636
I mean, if Malcolm were indeed corrupt,

408
00:14:24,704 --> 00:14:26,037
he'd be Aoudi's golden goose.

409
00:14:26,105 --> 00:14:27,672
It'd be quite dumb to shoot him.

410
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,307
What if someone else was here?

411
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,943
The cops searched the
place up and down, Chloe.

412
00:14:32,011 --> 00:14:33,345
There was no one else.

413
00:14:33,413 --> 00:14:36,615
Look, you may not want to believe it,

414
00:14:36,682 --> 00:14:38,517
but what if...?

415
00:14:38,584 --> 00:14:39,584
I was wrong.

416
00:14:39,585 --> 00:14:42,554
(cell phone ringing)

417
00:14:42,622 --> 00:14:44,423
Espinoza.

418
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,924
Uh, yeah.

419
00:14:45,992 --> 00:14:48,894
Okay, I will let her know.

420
00:14:48,961 --> 00:14:50,162
Did you really put out

421
00:14:50,229 --> 00:14:53,432
an APB for... angel wings?

422
00:14:55,535 --> 00:14:57,002
Maybe.

423
00:14:57,069 --> 00:14:59,571
Well, it looks like they got a hit.

424
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:00,906
Excellent!

425
00:15:00,973 --> 00:15:02,941
Right, my turn.

426
00:15:06,068 --> 00:15:08,326
I still can't believe
it that the wings are...

427
00:15:08,394 --> 00:15:09,861
Real? Exquisite? Divine?

428
00:15:09,928 --> 00:15:11,329
It's okay to say it.

429
00:15:11,397 --> 00:15:12,897
I was gonna say, "For sale."

430
00:15:12,965 --> 00:15:15,500
So, anything else the
FBI can tell us, Agent Pitts?

431
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:17,327
The wings... along with
a bunch of other crap

432
00:15:17,336 --> 00:15:19,270
people think is
real... are being pawned off

433
00:15:19,338 --> 00:15:21,005
at a black-market antiquities auction.

434
00:15:21,073 --> 00:15:22,306
An auction?

435
00:15:22,374 --> 00:15:24,108
Held under the veil of a
charity event at Crimson Hall.

436
00:15:24,176 --> 00:15:25,276
Saints' teeth?

437
00:15:25,344 --> 00:15:26,577
Holy napkins?

438
00:15:26,645 --> 00:15:27,879
Oh, a piece of the cross?

439
00:15:27,946 --> 00:15:29,986
They've got my wings in
absurdly fraudulent company.

440
00:15:30,049 --> 00:15:33,084
Yeah, unlike the wings, there's
no way those are real.

441
00:15:33,152 --> 00:15:34,519
Exactly, it's insulting!

442
00:15:34,586 --> 00:15:36,754
Putting my wings on the block
like some chintzy accoutrement.

443
00:15:36,822 --> 00:15:38,022
All right.

444
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,490
Well, you can take
comfort knowing the auction's

445
00:15:39,558 --> 00:15:41,726
already set to be raided tonight.

446
00:15:41,794 --> 00:15:43,728
So the FBI are gonna snatch my wings?

447
00:15:43,796 --> 00:15:45,363
When we get a chance to
pounce on the bad guys, we take it.

448
00:15:45,431 --> 00:15:46,931
The FBI is taking lead.

449
00:15:46,999 --> 00:15:48,399
Figured you might
be after the same guys.

450
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:50,234
And we have jurisdiction.

451
00:15:50,302 --> 00:15:52,770
Okay, so how do we get the wings back?

452
00:15:52,838 --> 00:15:53,938
After the raid?

453
00:15:54,006 --> 00:15:55,373
As long as you can
prove the wings' provenance,

454
00:15:55,441 --> 00:15:56,774
you'll get it back in 30 days.

455
00:15:56,842 --> 00:15:58,676
- No problem.
- 30 days.

456
00:15:58,744 --> 00:16:00,878
Yes, no problem, no problem at all.

457
00:16:00,946 --> 00:16:01,979
Right?

458
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,182
(quietly) Mm-hmm.

459
00:16:06,785 --> 00:16:08,720
 

460
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,964
(elevator bell dings)

461
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,205
(laughs)

462
00:16:27,272 --> 00:16:29,407
Come on out, Amenadiel.

463
00:16:32,144 --> 00:16:34,412
So what happened to going it alone,

464
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,947
lying in my own mess and such?

465
00:16:36,014 --> 00:16:37,949
Or did you just want a
front row seat to the action?

466
00:16:38,016 --> 00:16:39,150
I assure you, Lucifer,

467
00:16:39,218 --> 00:16:40,918
I take no pleasure
in following you around.

468
00:16:40,986 --> 00:16:43,988
But this is far too
important to let you screw up.

469
00:16:44,056 --> 00:16:46,657
Ah, so you just came to help?

470
00:16:46,725 --> 00:16:49,360
I came to ensure the wings
get back where they belong.

471
00:16:49,428 --> 00:16:51,062
Which is where exactly?

472
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:52,463
You mean besides on your back?

473
00:16:52,531 --> 00:16:54,011
Oh, surely, my fine-feathered friend,

474
00:16:54,066 --> 00:16:55,466
you don't expect that to happen.

475
00:16:55,534 --> 00:16:58,636
They belong in the
Heavens where they were created.

476
00:16:58,704 --> 00:17:01,572
If you don't want them,
that's where they'll be.

477
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,342
Fair enough.

478
00:17:04,409 --> 00:17:06,010
Considering we're on a clock now,

479
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:07,078
I could use a wingman.

480
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,913
What do you mean?

481
00:17:08,981 --> 00:17:10,748
The FBI's raiding the place.

482
00:17:10,816 --> 00:17:13,885
So if we don't get the
wings, humanity finds divinity,

483
00:17:13,952 --> 00:17:15,987
so on and so forth... you know the rest.

484
00:17:16,054 --> 00:17:17,688
Well, we can't let that happen.

485
00:17:17,756 --> 00:17:19,857
Right, so you can join.

486
00:17:19,925 --> 00:17:21,259
Provided, of course, you can keep

487
00:17:21,326 --> 00:17:23,394
that angelic ego of yours in check.

488
00:17:23,462 --> 00:17:24,695
I don't have an ego.

489
00:17:24,763 --> 00:17:26,964
Sure you do, but I'm encouraging
you to get off

490
00:17:27,032 --> 00:17:29,233
that high horse and learn a
thing or two about humanity.

491
00:17:29,301 --> 00:17:32,336
Though it appears that
you've picked up a fashion sense.

492
00:17:32,404 --> 00:17:33,638
So that's, uh... (sighs)

493
00:17:33,705 --> 00:17:35,973
I miss the dress.

494
00:17:37,509 --> 00:17:39,043
(beeping)

495
00:17:41,847 --> 00:17:43,181
Hello.

496
00:17:43,248 --> 00:17:44,015
Private party.

497
00:17:44,082 --> 00:17:46,818
(stammers) Honey, not vinegar.

498
00:17:47,853 --> 00:17:49,620
Yes, excuse me, I understand

499
00:17:49,688 --> 00:17:50,955
this event is very exclusive.

500
00:17:51,023 --> 00:17:54,826
But, uh, surely you've got room for just

501
00:17:54,893 --> 00:17:56,427
two more?

502
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:00,832
Unless you got business here, scram.

503
00:18:06,171 --> 00:18:08,573
It's funny you
should say that, actually.

504
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,875
Perhaps I do have
something that might interest

505
00:18:10,943 --> 00:18:13,945
those keen on religious relics.

506
00:18:20,352 --> 00:18:21,586
Right this way, gentlemen.

507
00:18:21,653 --> 00:18:23,321
Thank you.

508
00:18:23,388 --> 00:18:25,523
Did you catch all that?

509
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:32,909
CHLOE: (sighs) I can't
believe I agreed to this.

510
00:18:32,965 --> 00:18:34,532
I thought you were helping me.

511
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,733
I am helping.

512
00:18:35,801 --> 00:18:36,968
We went to Palmetto, right?

513
00:18:37,035 --> 00:18:38,336
We went over everything that happened.

514
00:18:38,403 --> 00:18:41,038
- And found nothing.
- Exactly.

515
00:18:41,106 --> 00:18:43,975
Now I want to show you
who your case is about.

516
00:18:44,042 --> 00:18:45,776
(sighs)

517
00:18:45,844 --> 00:18:48,112
This is who's on the
other end of this case.

518
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,780
Not a monster.

519
00:18:49,848 --> 00:18:50,982
Not a villain.

520
00:18:51,049 --> 00:18:53,818
But a grieving family
trying to say goodbye.

521
00:18:55,053 --> 00:18:57,021
(groans) She saw us.

522
00:19:01,426 --> 00:19:03,127
What is she doing here?

523
00:19:03,195 --> 00:19:04,262
I'm sorry, Mel.

524
00:19:04,329 --> 00:19:06,163
She's not, she's
not looking for a fight.

525
00:19:06,231 --> 00:19:07,999
(scoffs) Are you kidding?

526
00:19:08,066 --> 00:19:09,300
A fight?

527
00:19:09,368 --> 00:19:11,168
She...

528
00:19:11,236 --> 00:19:14,171
You have no right.

529
00:19:14,239 --> 00:19:15,907
What do you want from us?

530
00:19:15,974 --> 00:19:17,708
(sighs)

531
00:19:17,776 --> 00:19:20,745
I'm-I'm so sorry for your loss.

532
00:19:20,812 --> 00:19:23,180
(scoffs)

533
00:19:23,248 --> 00:19:25,616
Just go.

534
00:19:25,684 --> 00:19:27,818
Please, just...

535
00:19:29,554 --> 00:19:31,656
(door closes)

536
00:19:33,358 --> 00:19:35,960
Carmen?

537
00:19:36,028 --> 00:19:38,129
It's like nothing I've ever seen.

538
00:19:46,038 --> 00:19:48,940
Congratulations, Mr. Morningstar.

539
00:19:49,007 --> 00:19:52,944
The Catholics and the
Satanists will be clawing for this coin.

540
00:19:53,011 --> 00:19:56,147
With any luck, we may even
have a bidding war on our hands.

541
00:19:56,214 --> 00:19:57,715
Wouldn't that be fun?

542
00:19:57,783 --> 00:19:59,317
Who would've thought,
eh, the devil's coin,

543
00:19:59,384 --> 00:20:02,053
- worthy of so much love?
- Put a bunch of believers in a room

544
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,890
and... pardon the pun... but
sky's the limit. (chuckles)

545
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,158
(chuckles) That's very good.

546
00:20:07,225 --> 00:20:08,693
If I didn't know any better, I would say

547
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,562
that you don't
respect your buyers' faith.

548
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:12,997
Oh, quite the contrary.

549
00:20:13,065 --> 00:20:15,466
I respect my customers' faith very much.

550
00:20:15,534 --> 00:20:16,867
But I don't have to
share in their beliefs

551
00:20:16,935 --> 00:20:18,769
to profit from them. (chuckles)

552
00:20:18,837 --> 00:20:21,806
So I take it you're not a believer then?

553
00:20:21,873 --> 00:20:25,276
I'm a man that
believes in one simple divinity,

554
00:20:25,344 --> 00:20:27,345
the almighty dollar.

555
00:20:27,412 --> 00:20:28,946
(laughter)

556
00:20:31,183 --> 00:20:33,484
Humans.

557
00:20:33,552 --> 00:20:35,353
Am I right? (clears throat)

558
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,621
I have to admit,

559
00:20:37,689 --> 00:20:40,958
I love being the bearer of bad news.

560
00:20:41,026 --> 00:20:43,094
Oh? Do tell.

561
00:20:43,161 --> 00:20:44,595
The coin's not for sale.

562
00:20:44,663 --> 00:20:47,531
I simply used it to gain entrée to you.

563
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:49,600
Then why are you here?

564
00:20:49,668 --> 00:20:51,102
Someone stole my wings.

565
00:20:51,169 --> 00:20:53,704
About six feet, glow
with the light of God.

566
00:20:53,772 --> 00:20:57,608
So if you'd be so kind as to
deliver them, then we can be

567
00:20:57,676 --> 00:20:59,310
on our way without any...

568
00:20:59,378 --> 00:21:01,345
unpleasantries.

569
00:21:01,413 --> 00:21:02,880
Funny.

570
00:21:02,948 --> 00:21:05,716
That's not how this works.

571
00:21:05,784 --> 00:21:07,551
- (guns cocking)
- (chuckles)

572
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:09,987
Oh, you men don't know
who you're dealing with.

573
00:21:10,055 --> 00:21:12,790
Those guns don't frighten us.

574
00:21:12,858 --> 00:21:14,358
In fact,

575
00:21:14,426 --> 00:21:16,660
I dare you to shoot.

576
00:21:17,264 --> 00:21:18,195
Brother...

577
00:21:18,263 --> 00:21:19,463
Go ahead.

578
00:21:19,531 --> 00:21:21,532
See what happens.

579
00:21:23,769 --> 00:21:26,931
And there's that angelic
ego I was talking about.

580
00:21:31,004 --> 00:21:33,939
I'm sorry, uh... You were saying?

581
00:21:34,007 --> 00:21:36,275
Gentlemen, please... (laughs)

582
00:21:36,343 --> 00:21:37,743
Don't mind my brother.

583
00:21:37,811 --> 00:21:39,411
He's just a bit... simple.

584
00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:42,148
We meant no disrespect, truly.

585
00:21:42,215 --> 00:21:43,566
I thought you told me
you wanted your wings back.

586
00:21:43,591 --> 00:21:46,452
I do. But this is
hardly the way to go about it.

587
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,853
Give me one good reason

588
00:21:47,921 --> 00:21:49,722
not to finish this right now.

589
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,590
LUCIFER: Because you misunderstood me.

590
00:21:51,658 --> 00:21:53,993
I'm more than happy to buy the wings,

591
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,862
like everyone else, with cash.

592
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:58,664
A whole boatload of money.

593
00:21:58,732 --> 00:22:00,432
If you truly worship the dollar,

594
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,768
then I'm your ticket to divinity.

595
00:22:07,707 --> 00:22:10,242
Happy bidding.

596
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,577
(sighs)

597
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:13,846
Thank you.

598
00:22:19,286 --> 00:22:22,221
 Everybody knows
when, ah, tell me again 

599
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:25,357
 Fatten up the pig and,
baby, let's pretend 

600
00:22:25,425 --> 00:22:27,960
 That I could see the
joke at the beginning or end... 

601
00:22:28,028 --> 00:22:29,295
LUCIFER: It's funny,
isn't it, how all it takes

602
00:22:29,362 --> 00:22:31,430
to unite the faiths
of the world is a bit

603
00:22:31,498 --> 00:22:33,299
of illegal consumerism.

604
00:22:33,366 --> 00:22:34,433
Mmm.

605
00:22:34,501 --> 00:22:35,501
What I'd like to know

606
00:22:35,502 --> 00:22:38,504
is since when is the Prince of Darkness

607
00:22:38,572 --> 00:22:41,106
scared of some insufferable human gun?

608
00:22:41,174 --> 00:22:43,075
Well, since I, uh...

609
00:22:43,143 --> 00:22:44,376
I bled.

610
00:22:44,444 --> 00:22:46,579
- What do you mean, bled?
- Yep.

611
00:22:46,646 --> 00:22:49,281
Don't know how it's possible,
but on top of everything else,

612
00:22:49,349 --> 00:22:51,750
seems I'm dealing with a
bit of a mortality sitch.

613
00:22:51,818 --> 00:22:54,220
Hence: ixnay on the unsgay.

614
00:22:55,121 --> 00:22:56,655
What are you grinning about?

615
00:22:56,723 --> 00:22:59,792
I'm just realizing the
gravity of what you're saying.

616
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,460
That I'm allergic to lead projectiles?

617
00:23:01,528 --> 00:23:03,162
That even if you don't choose Hell,

618
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:08,901
all I have do is wait for some
pitiful thug to end you

619
00:23:08,969 --> 00:23:12,438
and right back to Hell you go.

620
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:17,009
You hadn't put that one together
yet, had you, Lucy?

621
00:23:18,044 --> 00:23:20,279
You just made my millennium.

622
00:23:20,347 --> 00:23:22,214
(chuckles)

623
00:23:22,282 --> 00:23:24,583
CARMEN: Good
evening, ladies and gentlemen.

624
00:23:24,651 --> 00:23:26,085
I'm Carmen Grant

625
00:23:26,152 --> 00:23:29,555
and I humbly welcome
you to our Evening of Faith.

626
00:23:29,623 --> 00:23:32,091
(applause)

627
00:23:32,158 --> 00:23:34,026
Tonight we shall behold items

628
00:23:34,094 --> 00:23:36,896
that prove the miraculous is real.

629
00:23:36,963 --> 00:23:39,064
There is a power we can't see,

630
00:23:39,132 --> 00:23:41,567
but its light burns
bright in the priceless artifacts

631
00:23:41,635 --> 00:23:44,937
that have traveled from around the world

632
00:23:45,005 --> 00:23:48,140
and, dare I say, Heaven and Hell,

633
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:50,342
to find their way to you!

634
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:52,311
(applause)

635
00:23:55,081 --> 00:23:57,583
Without further ado,

636
00:23:57,651 --> 00:24:01,086
I would like to introduce
you to the first item up for bid...

637
00:24:01,154 --> 00:24:04,356
the Lost Chains of St. Paul!

638
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:07,559
According to tradition,

639
00:24:07,627 --> 00:24:09,828
St. Paul was imprisoned

640
00:24:09,896 --> 00:24:11,697
between 61 and 63 AD.

641
00:24:11,765 --> 00:24:15,668
While some pieces are on
display at the Papal Basilica...

642
00:24:15,735 --> 00:24:17,536
or so they say...

643
00:24:17,604 --> 00:24:20,172
these are the missing links.

644
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,574
Paul's wrists were too
thick to fit in those chains.

645
00:24:22,642 --> 00:24:24,944
I know. That man never could
pass on dessert, could he?

646
00:24:25,011 --> 00:24:26,411
He should have been the Saint of...

647
00:24:26,413 --> 00:24:27,579
Honey cakes?

648
00:24:27,647 --> 00:24:29,848
(laughing)

649
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,918
Those are clearly fake!

650
00:24:32,986 --> 00:24:34,253
- What?
- Shh!

651
00:24:34,321 --> 00:24:35,354
Shh.

652
00:24:35,422 --> 00:24:37,723
Ooh. Tough crowd.

653
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:40,659
You don't know the half of it.

654
00:24:40,727 --> 00:24:42,061
How did I know you'd come here?

655
00:24:42,128 --> 00:24:43,963
Because I'm admirably consistent?

656
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,631
How did you even get in here?

657
00:24:45,699 --> 00:24:46,765
Oh, I've got news for you, pal.

658
00:24:46,833 --> 00:24:48,513
You're not the only
one with a little mojo.

659
00:24:48,535 --> 00:24:50,035
Mmm. Touché.

660
00:24:50,103 --> 00:24:51,370
And you're welcome, by the way.

661
00:24:51,438 --> 00:24:52,638
I came here to warn you.

662
00:24:52,706 --> 00:24:54,506
In about five minutes, the
FBI's gonna storm this place,

663
00:24:54,574 --> 00:24:55,741
so we have to go now.

664
00:24:55,809 --> 00:24:57,376
But we were just getting started.

665
00:24:57,444 --> 00:24:59,411
"We"?

666
00:24:59,479 --> 00:25:01,080
Oh, that's right. You
haven't met, have you?

667
00:25:01,147 --> 00:25:02,648
Allow me to introduce

668
00:25:02,716 --> 00:25:03,916
Amenadiel.

669
00:25:03,984 --> 00:25:04,984
My brother.

670
00:25:04,985 --> 00:25:06,552
Well, come on,

671
00:25:06,619 --> 00:25:07,820
don't look so shocked.

672
00:25:07,887 --> 00:25:09,355
Um...

673
00:25:09,422 --> 00:25:12,091
I just didn't

674
00:25:12,158 --> 00:25:13,993
expect your brother to be...

675
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,595
so... handsome.

676
00:25:16,663 --> 00:25:18,464
AMENADIEL: We're all
full of surprises, it seems.

677
00:25:18,531 --> 00:25:21,934
I never expected my brother
to change careers as he did.

678
00:25:22,002 --> 00:25:25,137
But I'm definitely beginning to see why.

679
00:25:26,106 --> 00:25:28,040
Lucifer, your brother got

680
00:25:28,108 --> 00:25:29,675
all the charm in the family.

681
00:25:29,743 --> 00:25:30,943
Okay, that's enough of that.

682
00:25:31,011 --> 00:25:32,611
It's unsettling to
see you two get along.

683
00:25:33,446 --> 00:25:34,613
CARMEN: Next up.

684
00:25:36,282 --> 00:25:37,750
(crowd exclaiming, applauding)

685
00:25:37,817 --> 00:25:40,085
The wings of an angel.

686
00:25:47,761 --> 00:25:49,461
(whispers) They're gorgeous.

687
00:25:52,532 --> 00:25:53,532
MAN: Freeze! FBI!

688
00:25:53,533 --> 00:25:55,334
- (crowd gasps)
- MAN: What's going on?

689
00:25:55,402 --> 00:25:56,568
Everyone, stay where you are!

690
00:25:56,636 --> 00:25:57,903
Don't move!

691
00:26:00,974 --> 00:26:02,408
Stay where you are.

692
00:26:03,611 --> 00:26:04,543
BODYGUARD: Mr. Grant.

693
00:26:04,611 --> 00:26:05,611
Nobody move.

694
00:26:05,612 --> 00:26:06,645
Come on.

695
00:26:06,713 --> 00:26:08,981
Stop! Freeze!

696
00:26:17,457 --> 00:26:18,991
Where'd he go?

697
00:26:20,326 --> 00:26:21,894
A little help.

698
00:26:22,896 --> 00:26:24,430
Please.

699
00:26:26,766 --> 00:26:28,133
(exhales)

700
00:26:33,339 --> 00:26:35,441
Thank you.

701
00:27:01,935 --> 00:27:04,303
They're fake.

702
00:27:08,061 --> 00:27:10,463
I telling you, I saw him come in here.

703
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:12,098
(indistinct radio transmission)

704
00:27:15,102 --> 00:27:17,903
(whispers) There was a secret door.

705
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:21,307
I see you got your wings.

706
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:23,075
Thought you'd be happier.

707
00:27:23,143 --> 00:27:24,610
These aren't my wings.

708
00:27:24,678 --> 00:27:26,612
Whose wings are they?

709
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,648
Someone with a warped sense of humor.

710
00:27:28,715 --> 00:27:30,082
- I don't...
- They're a knockoff,

711
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,450
a sham.

712
00:27:31,518 --> 00:27:33,552
I mean, it's good
work, I'll give them that.

713
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,755
Probably would've
fooled just about anyone,

714
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:38,224
save perhaps the actual
owner of the wings.

715
00:27:38,292 --> 00:27:40,693
The actual owner... being you?

716
00:27:40,761 --> 00:27:42,094
Yeah, they must've been switched out.

717
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:44,163
It's no coincidence that my
wings are stolen one day,

718
00:27:44,231 --> 00:27:47,800
and then Carmen's selling an
exact replica a week later.

719
00:27:47,868 --> 00:27:49,635
No, this is some serious foul play.

720
00:27:49,703 --> 00:27:51,637
I-I'm sorry to hear that, sincerely.

721
00:27:51,705 --> 00:27:54,284
But there's something at Palmetto

722
00:27:54,438 --> 00:27:55,654
that I need to take care of, so...

723
00:27:55,655 --> 00:27:57,778
Are you coming?

724
00:27:57,844 --> 00:27:59,211
Didn't you hear me?

725
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,680
My wings are still out there.

726
00:28:00,747 --> 00:28:02,048
I need to find them.

727
00:28:02,115 --> 00:28:04,083
If you want to run off to
Palmetto, be my guest,

728
00:28:04,151 --> 00:28:06,385
but no more role-playing for me, thanks.

729
00:28:06,453 --> 00:28:08,688
So I came to save your ass,
but just because these wings

730
00:28:08,755 --> 00:28:09,855
aren't the ones you wanted,

731
00:28:09,923 --> 00:28:11,490
that's it? We're done?

732
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:15,594
So much for quid pro quo.

733
00:28:15,662 --> 00:28:17,263
Ah.

734
00:28:18,532 --> 00:28:20,499
You sure you don't
want to chase after her?

735
00:28:20,567 --> 00:28:24,170
Maybe I can ask Father for
some rain and make it a moment.

736
00:28:27,974 --> 00:28:30,776
All right.

737
00:28:30,844 --> 00:28:32,445
So what's our next move?

738
00:28:32,512 --> 00:28:35,548
Well, I'm afraid this is where
I leave you, brother.

739
00:28:35,615 --> 00:28:36,782
What I'm about to do

740
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,251
is the Devil's work.

741
00:28:46,026 --> 00:28:48,961
I thought we were
finally done with all this.

742
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:50,496
(sighs) I was done.

743
00:28:50,564 --> 00:28:52,932
I even started believing I
was crazy like everybody said.

744
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:54,934
I never said you were crazy.

745
00:28:55,001 --> 00:28:56,836
Yeah. It's okay.

746
00:28:56,903 --> 00:28:58,871
I would've thought I was, too.

747
00:28:58,939 --> 00:29:00,773
But, you know, I got to thinking.

748
00:29:00,841 --> 00:29:02,875
Lucifer pointed out
that it made no sense

749
00:29:02,943 --> 00:29:04,777
for Aoudi to shoot his
inside man, right?

750
00:29:04,845 --> 00:29:06,445
Right.

751
00:29:07,514 --> 00:29:09,348
But no one else was there.

752
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:12,518
No one could've shot Malcolm and
fled without me seeing them.

753
00:29:12,586 --> 00:29:13,652
- Now you're making my point.
- Because

754
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,455
there was no obvious exit.

755
00:29:16,523 --> 00:29:17,556
But maybe,

756
00:29:17,624 --> 00:29:19,558
just maybe... hear me out...

757
00:29:19,626 --> 00:29:21,360
there was a secret one.

758
00:29:21,428 --> 00:29:24,263
Chloe, you are stabbing
hard at something

759
00:29:24,331 --> 00:29:26,232
- that's just not there.
- There's got to be an explanation

760
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:27,933
for what I saw, Dan! There has to be.

761
00:29:28,001 --> 00:29:30,136
What do you need me to do?

762
00:29:30,203 --> 00:29:31,203
- I don't...
- (creaking)

763
00:29:34,074 --> 00:29:36,008
What was that?

764
00:29:36,076 --> 00:29:38,477
(creaking)

765
00:30:09,342 --> 00:30:11,277
Looks like it leads up to the street.

766
00:30:14,314 --> 00:30:16,315
Hey.

767
00:30:18,385 --> 00:30:20,352
What is it?

768
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,021
A 999 key.

769
00:30:22,088 --> 00:30:23,956
LAPD-issued.

770
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:26,959
Malcolm had his on him.

771
00:30:27,027 --> 00:30:29,795
- Wait. Are-are you saying...
- Yes.

772
00:30:29,863 --> 00:30:31,697
Another cop was here.

773
00:30:31,765 --> 00:30:33,365
- I was right.
- Chloe,

774
00:30:33,433 --> 00:30:34,667
- this could mean a lot of things...
- It means

775
00:30:34,734 --> 00:30:36,202
a cop knew

776
00:30:36,269 --> 00:30:38,838
this secret passageway existed, Dan.

777
00:30:38,905 --> 00:30:40,339
And chances are,

778
00:30:40,407 --> 00:30:42,308
whoever it was shot Malcolm, so...

779
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:43,142
Yeah. But why?

780
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:45,311
That's what I got to figure out.

781
00:30:45,378 --> 00:30:47,746
No.

782
00:30:47,814 --> 00:30:49,648
That's what we need to figure out.

783
00:31:03,396 --> 00:31:05,331
(doorbell rings)

784
00:31:14,674 --> 00:31:16,609
It's...

785
00:31:16,676 --> 00:31:17,843
you.

786
00:31:17,911 --> 00:31:19,578
That's right, me,

787
00:31:19,646 --> 00:31:22,281
Lucifer bloody Morningstar.

788
00:31:22,349 --> 00:31:24,483
Do you mind if I come in?

789
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:25,684
You, Carmen,

790
00:31:25,752 --> 00:31:27,632
slightly more difficult
to identify, aren't you?

791
00:31:27,687 --> 00:31:30,089
No phone, no bank account,

792
00:31:30,156 --> 00:31:32,358
home registered under one
of your many aliases.

793
00:31:32,425 --> 00:31:35,227
Seems wings aren't the only
thing you falsify, eh?

794
00:31:35,295 --> 00:31:37,295
- I can explain...
- I'm still moved by your words.

795
00:31:37,297 --> 00:31:40,232
"I'm a man that
believes in one simple divinity,

796
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,868
- the almighty dollar."
- You don't understand...

797
00:31:42,936 --> 00:31:45,604
No, I understand. Perfectly.

798
00:31:45,672 --> 00:31:47,206
A lifelong atheist,

799
00:31:47,274 --> 00:31:49,608
you took one peek at the wings

800
00:31:49,676 --> 00:31:52,011
and something changed in you.

801
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:54,013
The great white light was revealed

802
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,015
and a believer was born,

803
00:31:56,082 --> 00:32:00,419
one who couldn't
part with real divinity!

804
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,327
(exhales)

805
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:11,931
Oh, no.

806
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,001
Mounting my wings,

807
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:19,338
like some decorative stag head.

808
00:32:21,908 --> 00:32:24,643
(sighs)

809
00:32:24,711 --> 00:32:26,579
Shame on you.

810
00:32:26,646 --> 00:32:29,582
It wasn't my fault.

811
00:32:29,649 --> 00:32:31,584
Someone tipped me off.

812
00:32:31,651 --> 00:32:32,818
Excuses, excuses.

813
00:32:32,886 --> 00:32:35,120
"It wasn't me, it was
the biker that did it."

814
00:32:35,188 --> 00:32:37,089
I thought he was bringing
me a sculpture.

815
00:32:37,157 --> 00:32:38,591
Were you disappointed?

816
00:32:38,658 --> 00:32:39,818
I didn't know what they were.

817
00:32:39,859 --> 00:32:42,194
I never would have done
it if I had any idea

818
00:32:42,262 --> 00:32:43,929
what I was actually dealing with.

819
00:32:43,997 --> 00:32:46,432
Please, please.

820
00:32:46,499 --> 00:32:49,902
You can't take them away.

821
00:32:51,338 --> 00:32:53,205
I can't live without them.

822
00:32:53,273 --> 00:32:55,674
Perhaps you don't understand.

823
00:32:57,143 --> 00:32:59,812
(growling) They're mine.

824
00:32:59,879 --> 00:33:03,282
Now, before I deal with you,

825
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:07,486
I have just one
burning question on my mind.

826
00:33:09,556 --> 00:33:11,457
Who tipped you off?

827
00:33:26,473 --> 00:33:27,940
(chuckles dryly)

828
00:33:28,008 --> 00:33:29,675
I knew you'd come.

829
00:33:29,743 --> 00:33:31,176
Of course I'd come.

830
00:33:33,546 --> 00:33:36,415
It's my duty to return the
wings where they belong.

831
00:33:36,483 --> 00:33:38,417
Is that all?

832
00:33:38,485 --> 00:33:40,628
(chuckles)

833
00:33:42,989 --> 00:33:45,724
After everything that
you've been through...

834
00:33:45,792 --> 00:33:48,460
bleeding, searching,
reaching to the high heavens for help...

835
00:33:48,528 --> 00:33:50,896
now that you finally have your wings,

836
00:33:50,964 --> 00:33:53,932
doesn't part of you
long to assume your form?

837
00:33:55,835 --> 00:33:57,836
Get back to where you belong?

838
00:33:57,904 --> 00:33:59,571
(sighs)

839
00:34:03,977 --> 00:34:06,111
Not exactly.

840
00:34:10,183 --> 00:34:12,384
What are you doing?!

841
00:34:12,452 --> 00:34:14,453
Well, ruining your plan, it seems.

842
00:34:15,922 --> 00:34:17,389
It was you, brother.

843
00:34:17,457 --> 00:34:20,826
You tipped Carmen off, and
you orchestrated the theft.

844
00:34:20,894 --> 00:34:22,594
Because you left me no choice.

845
00:34:22,662 --> 00:34:23,862
(laughs)

846
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:26,131
Well, clearly you were desperate.

847
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:28,200
I mean, you were
willing to let a human die

848
00:34:28,268 --> 00:34:30,669
and unleash the wings upon the world

849
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:32,638
just to remind me who I was.

850
00:34:32,706 --> 00:34:35,374
(laughs) To fool me

851
00:34:35,442 --> 00:34:37,176
into desiring the wings

852
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:38,911
and the hellish throne they accompany.

853
00:34:38,978 --> 00:34:41,380
Well, do you know what?

854
00:34:42,482 --> 00:34:44,783
It almost bloody worked.

855
00:34:44,851 --> 00:34:46,452
But destroy them?

856
00:34:48,321 --> 00:34:49,388
Why?

857
00:34:49,456 --> 00:34:51,457
Well, you were right.

858
00:34:51,524 --> 00:34:54,059
Severing the wings was a half measure.

859
00:34:54,127 --> 00:34:56,428
I did leave myself an out.

860
00:34:56,496 --> 00:35:00,365
A rip cord back to the life that
dear old Dad chose for me.

861
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:02,167
But I don't need it now,

862
00:35:02,235 --> 00:35:07,005
because, in case I haven't made
myself abundantly clear,

863
00:35:07,073 --> 00:35:10,776
I'm never going back to Hell.

864
00:35:19,152 --> 00:35:20,552
But, uh...

865
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,354
A for effort.

866
00:35:22,422 --> 00:35:26,825
I'm sure Dad will give you
a big gold star for trying.

867
00:35:26,893 --> 00:35:28,694
(bellowing)

868
00:35:34,434 --> 00:35:36,702
(laughing) That's
right, hit me, brother.

869
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:37,970
Go on, again.

870
00:35:38,038 --> 00:35:39,104
Become like me.

871
00:35:39,172 --> 00:35:40,172
Become wrath.

872
00:35:40,173 --> 00:35:41,740
Fall as I did!

873
00:35:41,808 --> 00:35:43,475
(laughs)

874
00:35:43,543 --> 00:35:44,677
Come on.

875
00:35:48,014 --> 00:35:50,215
Come on.

876
00:35:50,283 --> 00:35:51,383
(chuckles)

877
00:35:53,887 --> 00:35:57,256
You never were much of
a closer, were you, eh?

878
00:35:57,324 --> 00:36:01,026
Can't stand to get your hands dirty.

879
00:36:01,094 --> 00:36:02,094
(chuckles)

880
00:36:02,095 --> 00:36:04,396
This is far from over.

881
00:36:11,137 --> 00:36:14,473
I'll do whatever it
takes to get you back to hell.

882
00:36:29,255 --> 00:36:31,623
He was like a brother to me.

883
00:36:31,691 --> 00:36:33,325
And for the last eight years,

884
00:36:33,393 --> 00:36:35,995
he was the best damn partner

885
00:36:36,062 --> 00:36:38,364
that I could've asked for.

886
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,767
(sighs)

887
00:36:45,572 --> 00:36:48,407
You know, I-I remember
one time that he...

888
00:36:49,943 --> 00:36:52,644
What in the hell...?

889
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:57,850
What part of "not
welcome" does she not understand?

890
00:36:57,917 --> 00:36:59,918
Easy, Anthony. Easy.

891
00:36:59,986 --> 00:37:01,720
You got some nerve, Decker.

892
00:37:01,788 --> 00:37:03,889
(sighs)

893
00:37:03,957 --> 00:37:06,525
I'd like to say a few
things about Malcolm.

894
00:37:09,062 --> 00:37:11,263
He was a hero,

895
00:37:11,331 --> 00:37:14,533
who got shot doing what
all of us do every day,

896
00:37:14,601 --> 00:37:17,469
by putting himself in the line of fire.

897
00:37:18,438 --> 00:37:19,338
I can't take back

898
00:37:19,406 --> 00:37:21,673
the things I've said.

899
00:37:21,741 --> 00:37:24,410
But I can promise

900
00:37:24,477 --> 00:37:26,412
not to let his life...

901
00:37:26,479 --> 00:37:28,747
or death... go in vain.

902
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:34,887
And for any pain that I've caused...

903
00:37:34,954 --> 00:37:38,891
his family or otherwise...

904
00:37:38,958 --> 00:37:40,492
I'm sorry.

905
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,729
I'm closing the case against him.

906
00:37:46,766 --> 00:37:48,434
To a good cop.

907
00:37:51,638 --> 00:37:53,338
To Malcolm.

908
00:37:55,875 --> 00:37:57,810
To Malcolm.

909
00:37:57,877 --> 00:37:59,711
ALL: To Malcolm.

910
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:14,526
I hope you're right about this.

911
00:38:14,594 --> 00:38:16,528
Trust me, if we're gonna
find a dirty cop,

912
00:38:16,596 --> 00:38:18,464
it's best they
don't think we're looking.

913
00:38:18,531 --> 00:38:21,867
(piano plays Johnny
Cash's version of "Hurt")

914
00:38:33,546 --> 00:38:37,216
I cleaned up your mess on the beach.

915
00:38:37,283 --> 00:38:39,751
I'm here to stay, Maze.

916
00:38:39,819 --> 00:38:41,286
(sighs)

917
00:38:41,354 --> 00:38:43,555
And I truly hate to disappoint you,

918
00:38:43,623 --> 00:38:47,626
but... well, this is
where I have to be now.

919
00:38:47,694 --> 00:38:52,498
And I know, even with
all the sex and drugs...

920
00:38:52,565 --> 00:38:54,500
and more sex,

921
00:38:54,567 --> 00:38:57,669
this isn't what you bargained for.

922
00:38:57,737 --> 00:39:01,140
And I know you made a vow, but...

923
00:39:01,207 --> 00:39:03,408
But nothing.

924
00:39:04,978 --> 00:39:06,478
I am with you, Lucifer,

925
00:39:06,546 --> 00:39:08,747
from now until the end.

926
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:13,418
We're a team, right?

927
00:39:15,889 --> 00:39:17,823
Of course.

928
00:39:25,198 --> 00:39:27,699
Now... (sighs)

929
00:39:27,767 --> 00:39:29,134
you should get some ice.

930
00:39:29,202 --> 00:39:31,336
Yeah.

931
00:39:34,274 --> 00:39:36,408
(sighs) Hmm.

932
00:39:38,077 --> 00:39:41,146
 1:00 a.m. 

933
00:39:41,214 --> 00:39:46,318
 You're invited... 

934
00:39:47,253 --> 00:39:49,188
What happened?

935
00:39:49,255 --> 00:39:51,156
Hmm? Oh.

936
00:39:51,224 --> 00:39:53,258
(laughing): Sorry. This, yes.

937
00:39:53,326 --> 00:39:55,794
Just a little, you
know, squabble with my bro.

938
00:39:55,862 --> 00:39:57,696
Nothing serious.

939
00:39:57,764 --> 00:39:59,898
(sighs)

940
00:39:59,966 --> 00:40:01,700
I don't...

941
00:40:01,768 --> 00:40:05,103
I don't like how we left
it at the auction.

942
00:40:05,171 --> 00:40:07,973
Yes. Yes, I...

943
00:40:08,041 --> 00:40:09,942
I agree.

944
00:40:10,009 --> 00:40:12,778
You definitely could
have handled things better.

945
00:40:12,845 --> 00:40:14,046
(laughs)

946
00:40:14,113 --> 00:40:17,683
And I supposed, you know, I...

947
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,952
- Sorry. What was I saying?
- (laughs)

948
00:40:20,019 --> 00:40:23,522
(sighs)

949
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:28,126
Look, I know how
much it sucks being alone.

950
00:40:28,194 --> 00:40:30,596
And I can't pretend to understand

951
00:40:30,663 --> 00:40:32,998
why the wings meant so much to you.

952
00:40:33,066 --> 00:40:35,300
(sighs)

953
00:40:35,368 --> 00:40:37,369
But if we're really friends, it...

954
00:40:37,437 --> 00:40:40,706
it should be enough
just knowing that they did.

955
00:40:44,177 --> 00:40:45,577
The wings are old news now.

956
00:40:45,645 --> 00:40:47,579
(chuckles, clears his throat)

957
00:40:47,647 --> 00:40:49,615
Earlier they were all
you could think about.

958
00:40:49,682 --> 00:40:52,150
Now you just don't care?

959
00:40:52,218 --> 00:40:54,219
Well, in my search for the wings,

960
00:40:54,287 --> 00:40:56,321
I realized what they actually were.

961
00:40:56,389 --> 00:40:58,824
A relic worth exactly

962
00:40:58,891 --> 00:41:01,727
what someone was
willing to pay for them.

963
00:41:01,794 --> 00:41:04,229
What can I say?

964
00:41:04,297 --> 00:41:07,466
I've moved on to
bigger and better things.

965
00:41:07,533 --> 00:41:09,167
So, what changed?

966
00:41:09,235 --> 00:41:10,936
I don't know.

967
00:41:11,004 --> 00:41:13,805
Huh.

968
00:41:13,873 --> 00:41:15,507
Or won't say.

969
00:41:15,575 --> 00:41:16,875
(laughs)

970
00:41:16,943 --> 00:41:19,378
Well, how'd your
Palmetto thing go anyway?

971
00:41:19,445 --> 00:41:22,080
Hmm? Did you find the
answer you were looking for?

972
00:41:22,148 --> 00:41:23,749
(sighs)

973
00:41:23,816 --> 00:41:25,083
I found something.

974
00:41:25,151 --> 00:41:27,986
Oh. Well.

975
00:41:28,054 --> 00:41:31,123
To our equally enigmatic futures.

976
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:36,461
 And take a breath 

977
00:41:36,529 --> 00:41:42,134
 Roll it until there's
nothing left 

978
00:41:42,201 --> 00:41:49,841
 Look in my eyes... 

979
00:41:52,912 --> 00:41:56,748
- (steady beeping)
-  And breathe into me... 

980
00:42:03,389 --> 00:42:05,724
(sniffling)

981
00:42:05,792 --> 00:42:08,160
(crying)

982
00:42:08,227 --> 00:42:09,294
(sobbing)

983
00:42:09,362 --> 00:42:10,362
(loud, droning beep)

984
00:42:10,363 --> 00:42:14,466
 Breathe into me 

985
00:42:14,534 --> 00:42:15,267
(crying)

986
00:42:15,335 --> 00:42:18,570
 Breathe into me 

987
00:42:21,074 --> 00:42:23,875
 Breathe into me... 

988
00:42:23,943 --> 00:42:25,577
(rhythmic beeping)

989
00:42:25,645 --> 00:42:26,845
What's going on?

990
00:42:26,913 --> 00:42:28,747
What's happening?

991
00:42:28,815 --> 00:42:30,482
(laughing) Oh!

992
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:32,384
- Seriously?
- Malcolm?

993
00:42:32,452 --> 00:42:34,553
(laughing) Malcolm.

994
00:42:40,059 --> 00:42:46,131
 Taste my breath 

995
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:48,633
 Do you like it?

996
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:51,307

00:00:01,587 --> 00:00:03,301
<i>Previously on Lucifer...</i>

2
00:00:03,436 --> 00:00:06,134
Ooh! How's your ex, Detective Douche?

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,958
Is this the fight that you want to pick?

4
00:00:08,094 --> 00:00:09,665
You stuck your neck out on Palmetto.

5
00:00:09,797 --> 00:00:11,487
- Look where that got you.
- Okay.

6
00:00:11,631 --> 00:00:13,915
Chloe, you are stabbing hard

7
00:00:13,915 --> 00:00:15,848
at something that's just not there.

8
00:00:15,993 --> 00:00:17,550
There's got to be an explanation

9
00:00:17,592 --> 00:00:18,554
for what I saw, Dan.

10
00:00:18,555 --> 00:00:19,426
There has to be!

11
00:00:19,578 --> 00:00:20,961
Chloe, this could mean

12
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:21,929
a lot of things.

13
00:00:21,996 --> 00:00:23,497
It means a cop knew

14
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,799
this secret passageway existed, Dan.

15
00:00:25,867 --> 00:00:27,301
- What is it?
- A 999 key.

16
00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:29,603
LAPD issued. I was right.

17
00:00:29,671 --> 00:00:32,172
It's my duty to return the
wings where they belong.

18
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,307
Doesn't part of you long

19
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:34,675
to assume your form?

20
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,577
Not exactly.

21
00:00:37,856 --> 00:00:39,743
I want what's best for Lucifer.

22
00:00:39,888 --> 00:00:40,673
Then give me something

23
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:42,401
that I can use against
Lucifer, and I'll make

24
00:00:42,402 --> 00:00:43,817
sure you're both back where you belong.

25
00:00:43,885 --> 00:00:44,985
That's the problem.

26
00:00:45,053 --> 00:00:46,587
He doesn't confide in me anymore.

27
00:00:46,654 --> 00:00:48,889
But there is someone he does talk to.

28
00:00:48,957 --> 00:00:49,823
A doctor.

29
00:00:49,891 --> 00:00:51,125
Hello there, neighbor.

30
00:00:51,192 --> 00:00:53,394
I actually need someone to confide in

31
00:00:53,461 --> 00:00:54,461
about a patient.

32
00:00:54,462 --> 00:00:55,262
And, hey, listen,

33
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,330
if you have any patients

34
00:00:56,398 --> 00:00:57,965
you need to talk about...

35
00:00:59,501 --> 00:01:02,436
You have no idea.

36
00:01:24,726 --> 00:01:26,059
Lovely. Thanks, girls.

37
00:01:28,642 --> 00:01:29,883
Ooh!

38
00:01:31,266 --> 00:01:32,699
We'll have to try that later.

39
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:37,571
Brian! Cheers!

40
00:01:46,414 --> 00:01:48,749
Maze! You haven't wished
me happy birthday.

41
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,617
The Devil doesn't have a birthday.

42
00:01:50,685 --> 00:01:51,752
Well, I do now.

43
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,820
I burned my wings.

44
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,154
I feel reborn.

45
00:01:54,222 --> 00:01:55,823
It's my re-birthday party.

46
00:01:56,891 --> 00:01:58,258
Reborn? As who?

47
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,093
Whoever the hell I want to be.

48
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,162
It's exciting, isn't it?

49
00:02:05,233 --> 00:02:07,367
Ha-ha.

50
00:02:09,904 --> 00:02:10,938
To new beginnings.

51
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,639
Happy birthday to me.

52
00:02:12,707 --> 00:02:14,341
Oh, how sweet.

53
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:15,642
She brought a date.

54
00:02:27,922 --> 00:02:29,590
You said "drinks
with a few friends."

55
00:02:29,657 --> 00:02:31,225
Well, you know, things got out of hand.

56
00:02:31,292 --> 00:02:33,193
Just the way I like it.

57
00:02:33,261 --> 00:02:34,928
We brought you a birthday gift.

58
00:02:34,996 --> 00:02:36,096
Is that the royal "we"?

59
00:02:36,164 --> 00:02:37,865
Whiskey with a pickle juice chaser.

60
00:02:37,932 --> 00:02:40,367
It's our station's birthday tradition.

61
00:02:40,435 --> 00:02:42,035
Lovely! How can I refuse?

62
00:02:42,103 --> 00:02:43,203
Can I refuse?

63
00:02:43,271 --> 00:02:44,338
Of course you can.

64
00:02:44,405 --> 00:02:46,640
And we'll always think less of you.

65
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,243
Here's to another trip around the sun.

66
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,577
Cheers.

67
00:02:56,918 --> 00:02:58,552
Ah! Ooh!

68
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,120
It's not bad, is it?

69
00:03:00,188 --> 00:03:01,188
Briny!

70
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:02,322
Let's find Maze.

71
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,091
She needs to try
this bizarre concoction.

72
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:05,993
She loves a salty aftertaste.

73
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,261
No. We're just stopping by.

74
00:03:07,328 --> 00:03:09,589
We have a department thing to go to.

75
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,364
Some of us work for a living.

76
00:03:10,431 --> 00:03:11,732
Well, that's your bad luck, isn't it?

77
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:13,800
Come on, the party's barely started.

78
00:03:14,802 --> 00:03:17,404
Happy birthday, Lucifer.

79
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,089
You sure you want to be here?

80
00:03:36,157 --> 00:03:37,658
We can't be the only ones

81
00:03:37,725 --> 00:03:39,426
missing Malcolm's welcome back party.

82
00:03:39,494 --> 00:03:41,061
If we want to find a dirty cop,

83
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:42,449
we got to look like team players.

84
00:03:42,497 --> 00:03:43,697
Chloe Decker!

85
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:44,765
Here we go.

86
00:03:54,142 --> 00:03:55,809
You and I need to talk.

87
00:03:55,877 --> 00:03:58,412
Sure, Malcolm.

88
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,749
You back with this guy?

89
00:04:02,817 --> 00:04:04,117
Hmm?

90
00:04:04,185 --> 00:04:05,385
How-how, how long was I out?

91
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,487
What, you get the sense knocked
out of you, Decker?

92
00:04:07,555 --> 00:04:09,355
- We're just, we're just...
- You know, we have...

93
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,550
Just relax, guys.

94
00:04:10,558 --> 00:04:12,192
I'm just... just giving you a hard time.

95
00:04:13,895 --> 00:04:16,095
You finally got your
sense of humor back, huh?

96
00:04:16,097 --> 00:04:18,065
Yeah, he's healing fast.

97
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,366
Doc said he should be able

98
00:04:19,434 --> 00:04:21,435
to get rid of this
chair in a couple days.

99
00:04:21,502 --> 00:04:24,037
You tired of pushing
me around, Paolucci?

100
00:04:26,341 --> 00:04:28,208
Look at that, huh?

101
00:04:28,276 --> 00:04:30,344
The partner who will not die.

102
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:33,347
Guess Heaven didn't want him

103
00:04:33,414 --> 00:04:34,681
and Hell couldn't keep him.

104
00:04:36,351 --> 00:04:37,918
You got no idea.

105
00:04:41,856 --> 00:04:43,590
So I, I may have been...

106
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,260
out of line last time I was here.

107
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,664
But I did send flowers.

108
00:04:50,732 --> 00:04:52,633
And chocolates.

109
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,335
And now myself, so, save
the best gift till last.

110
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:00,607
Not enough? No?

111
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,258
You can invite a friend.

112
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:06,913
Why did you think I'd be mad?

113
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,918
Was it because of this?

114
00:05:13,888 --> 00:05:15,022
I've found women, generally,

115
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:17,824
don't like a man
punching holes in things, yes.

116
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,195
Lucifer, our last
session was a breakthrough.

117
00:05:22,263 --> 00:05:24,731
It was?

118
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:27,300
You're finally getting in
touch with your emotions.

119
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,702
Letting your barriers down.

120
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,303
You see, that's part of the problem.

121
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,539
I'd like them back up, thank you.

122
00:05:32,607 --> 00:05:33,340
Why?

123
00:05:33,408 --> 00:05:34,541
Well, because these emotions

124
00:05:34,609 --> 00:05:38,345
are... bloody inconvenient, that's why.

125
00:05:39,647 --> 00:05:41,314
What's bothering you right now?

126
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,450
Well...

127
00:05:43,518 --> 00:05:45,318
right now I'm
experiencing a very odd feeling.

128
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,920
It's-it's like a...

129
00:05:46,988 --> 00:05:49,089
it's like a fat man sitting on my chest.

130
00:05:49,157 --> 00:05:52,059
But not in a fun way.

131
00:05:52,126 --> 00:05:54,361
And when is that happening?

132
00:05:55,296 --> 00:05:56,296
Well, um...

133
00:05:56,297 --> 00:05:57,564
When you're with Chloe?

134
00:05:57,632 --> 00:05:58,865
Yes.

135
00:05:58,933 --> 00:06:01,201
Well, actually, lately,
when she's been with Dan.

136
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:02,436
Her ex.

137
00:06:02,503 --> 00:06:04,438
Well, sort of. Uh...

138
00:06:04,505 --> 00:06:06,540
I don't know what she sees in that oaf.

139
00:06:06,607 --> 00:06:07,607
Lucifer...

140
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,077
you're jealous.

141
00:06:10,144 --> 00:06:13,246
The Devil doesn't get jealous.

142
00:06:13,314 --> 00:06:15,182
I'm the one who
inspires passion in others.

143
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:16,249
I mean...

144
00:06:16,284 --> 00:06:17,451
you know that.

145
00:06:17,518 --> 00:06:19,152
Mm, don't I ever.

146
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,220
Thank you.

147
00:06:20,221 --> 00:06:22,089
That's the appropriate response.

148
00:06:25,226 --> 00:06:26,560
Hold on, maybe it's not me.

149
00:06:26,627 --> 00:06:29,429
Maybe it's her.

150
00:06:29,497 --> 00:06:31,198
You could fix the detective.

151
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,433
How would I do that?

152
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:36,069
Well, heal her
douche fixation, obviously.

153
00:06:36,137 --> 00:06:37,938
Then she stays away from her ex.

154
00:06:38,005 --> 00:06:39,439
Then I get my partner back.

155
00:06:39,507 --> 00:06:41,541
That's not how therapy works.

156
00:06:42,477 --> 00:06:44,945
We deal with your issues.

157
00:06:45,012 --> 00:06:46,680
Not someone else's.

158
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:08,668
Oh, dear! Someone's session went poorly.

159
00:07:08,736 --> 00:07:10,570
Mm. Thanks for gracing
us with your presence.

160
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,239
Yes, I had a previous engagement.

161
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:15,597
Therapy twice in one day. So L.A. of me.

162
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:17,144
Dr. Bernie Shaw. Killed last night.

163
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:18,211
No forced entry.

164
00:07:18,212 --> 00:07:19,513
Killer most likely knew the vic.

165
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,314
The weapon was improvised.

166
00:07:21,382 --> 00:07:22,783
Seems like a crime of passion.

167
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,885
Right. Yeah.

168
00:07:24,952 --> 00:07:27,687
Have you ever seen a therapist?

169
00:07:27,755 --> 00:07:30,824
You know, for your pent-up
anger and your trust issues.

170
00:07:30,892 --> 00:07:32,592
And your attraction to very dull men.

171
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,162
Let's just focus on the case, shall we?

172
00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:36,797
Well, I will, once it's interesting.

173
00:07:36,864 --> 00:07:38,932
Oh! Hello.

174
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,234
It's interesting... "The
Cheater Therapist."

175
00:07:41,302 --> 00:07:43,470
Yeah, he encouraged couples
to cheat to save their marriages.

176
00:07:43,538 --> 00:07:45,572
You can imagine how
many people want to kill him.

177
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,574
I can't, actually. Sounds
like a great idea.

178
00:07:47,642 --> 00:07:49,910
You don't save a marriage by
sleeping with other people.

179
00:07:49,977 --> 00:07:51,378
It can't hurt to try.

180
00:07:52,246 --> 00:07:53,680
Pretty sure it can.

181
00:07:59,253 --> 00:08:01,454
That's the wife Alexandra.

182
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,123
She was out of town and just got back

183
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,257
to find her husband dead.

184
00:08:04,325 --> 00:08:05,759
Poor woman.

185
00:08:05,827 --> 00:08:07,594
Excuse me!

186
00:08:07,662 --> 00:08:09,229
Your husband was the Cheater Therapist.

187
00:08:09,297 --> 00:08:11,131
Hey, I'm not sure who you are,

188
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,066
but this is not the time for judgment.

189
00:08:13,134 --> 00:08:14,534
What? No judgment here, Tissue Lad.

190
00:08:14,602 --> 00:08:17,137
I think her husband's work was bang on!

191
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,271
I'm Detective Decker.

192
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:20,040
This is my associate, Mr. Morningstar.

193
00:08:20,107 --> 00:08:20,874
Yeah, yeah.

194
00:08:20,942 --> 00:08:22,275
Jonathan Medina.

195
00:08:22,343 --> 00:08:23,543
Colleague of Dr. Shaw's.

196
00:08:23,611 --> 00:08:26,146
Desire shouldn't be contained...
it's unnatural.

197
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,814
Your husband recognized that.

198
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:31,251
Bernie, he-he just wanted
to help people.

199
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:33,320
He dedicated his life to others.

200
00:08:34,188 --> 00:08:35,488
Who would do this?

201
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,424
We'll find out, Mrs. Shaw.

202
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,559
Hmm?

203
00:08:43,631 --> 00:08:46,557
Every one of her
husband's patients is a suspect.

204
00:08:46,558 --> 00:08:49,333
Oh! Does that mean we get
to dive into patient files?

205
00:08:49,334 --> 00:08:50,370
Read the deepest, darkest secrets

206
00:08:50,438 --> 00:08:51,705
of L.A.'s most unfaithful?

207
00:08:51,772 --> 00:08:53,473
No, we can't look at
them without a psychologist

208
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,408
to protect patient confidentiality.

209
00:08:55,476 --> 00:08:58,375
Perfect! I have just the psychologist!

210
00:08:58,376 --> 00:09:00,747
Dr. Linda Martin, from our first
investigation together.

211
00:09:00,815 --> 00:09:02,182
The one that wanted to jump your bones?

212
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,250
- Yeah.
- No. Not happening.

213
00:09:03,284 --> 00:09:04,317
No, I really think she'd bring some

214
00:09:04,385 --> 00:09:05,886
impressive insight into the issues

215
00:09:05,953 --> 00:09:06,987
that you're dealing with.

216
00:09:07,054 --> 00:09:08,388
Uh, in the case.

217
00:09:08,456 --> 00:09:10,176
I really don't. Plus,
it's out of our hands.

218
00:09:10,191 --> 00:09:12,592
Court-appointed. A
judge needs to sign off.

219
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,241
Wonderful! Now...

220
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:30,343
I see you brought your
gavel, like I asked.

221
00:09:35,082 --> 00:09:36,316
Oh!

222
00:09:36,384 --> 00:09:38,618
Oh, objection, Your Honor.

223

Synced and corrected by VitoSilans
- www.Addic7ed.com -

224
00:09:49,354 --> 00:09:50,388
Ah! Now, now...

225
00:09:50,455 --> 00:09:51,455
Oh, come on!

226
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,723
I won't tell if you won't.

227
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:55,026
I swore an oath... to a judge.

228
00:09:55,093 --> 00:09:56,327
Oh, did you now?

229
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:57,461
You only get to read the files

230
00:09:57,529 --> 00:09:58,930
I deem necessary for investigation.

231
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:02,166
Now, remember our deal.

232
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:04,368
You have to fix the
detective's broken douche meter

233
00:10:04,436 --> 00:10:06,196
- whilst we investigate this crime.
- Mm-hmm.

234
00:10:06,204 --> 00:10:08,306
- I never agreed to that.
- Oh, come now.

235
00:10:08,373 --> 00:10:09,874
Don't you want to help me?

236
00:10:12,477 --> 00:10:13,611
Hmm? Linda?

237
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,547
Lucifer...

238
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:18,416
Ah! Speak of the me.

239
00:10:18,483 --> 00:10:20,751
Out here. Now.

240
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:27,058
What did you do?

241
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,565
Not what, but who, if you must know.

242
00:10:28,627 --> 00:10:30,127
But I try not to kiss and tell.

243
00:10:30,195 --> 00:10:32,797
I told you I didn't
want to go with Dr. Martin.

244
00:10:32,864 --> 00:10:35,166
We need someone impartial, which means

245
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:37,735
not trying to get in
your pants. What...?

246
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,337
Are you even listening to me?

247
00:10:39,404 --> 00:10:40,604
Not really. Look.

248
00:10:40,672 --> 00:10:43,040
A new doctor's moved in.

249
00:10:43,108 --> 00:10:45,109
Dr. Canaan.

250
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:46,877
How Biblical.

251
00:10:46,945 --> 00:10:49,347
Sure, let's add another random
doctor to the case.

252
00:10:49,414 --> 00:10:50,748
Great idea.

253
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:54,051
Now, look, I assure
you, Dr. Martin is excellent.

254
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:56,087
She trained at
Stanford, she lectures at USC,

255
00:10:56,154 --> 00:10:57,621
she's got stacks of awards...

256
00:10:57,689 --> 00:10:59,657
Since when are you her fanboy?

257
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:00,891
Since I became a client.

258
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,226
You.

259
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:03,361
You're really in therapy?

260
00:11:03,428 --> 00:11:05,096
Why is that so surprising?

261
00:11:05,163 --> 00:11:06,530
You're the least reflective
person I know.

262
00:11:06,598 --> 00:11:07,598
I have layers.

263
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,266
I'm like an onion.

264
00:11:09,334 --> 00:11:10,868
An irresistible one.

265
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:12,236
Dr. Linda

266
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:14,238
said we recently made a
breakthrough, in fact.

267
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,173
Why do I think that's code for sex?

268
00:11:16,241 --> 00:11:17,875
In that particular context, no.

269
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:19,443
Do you still think you're the Devil?

270
00:11:19,511 --> 00:11:20,678
I am the Devil.

271
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:23,080
Then excuse me if I doubt her skills.

272
00:11:23,148 --> 00:11:24,468
Look, she's helped me, all right?

273
00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:25,716
And I think she can be of help here.

274
00:11:25,784 --> 00:11:27,418
- Uh-huh, I'm sure.
- Excuse me.

275
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:29,320
- Everything okay?
- Yes, Linda,

276
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:30,721
everything's absolutely
fine... No offense, Dr. Martin...

277
00:11:30,789 --> 00:11:32,156
I found something.

278
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:33,557
- Hello.
- What is it?

279
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,159
A patient named Richard Kester.

280
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:37,595
His wife convinced him to
try Dr. Shaw's therapy.

281
00:11:37,662 --> 00:11:39,163
Hmm, let me guess... didn't end well?

282
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:40,531
She had an affair.

283
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:41,732
They got divorced.

284
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,402
And then Richard sent Dr.
Shaw a death threat.

285
00:11:44,469 --> 00:11:47,138
It's been more than a
year, but that kind of anger

286
00:11:47,205 --> 00:11:48,639
can bubble up when you least expect it.

287
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:51,108
Add him to the list of angry patients.

288
00:11:51,176 --> 00:11:52,009
That's just it.

289
00:11:52,077 --> 00:11:54,011
Richard's the only one so far.

290
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,447
Dr. Shaw's patients seem
remarkably happy with him.

291
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:57,548
Oh, do they now?

292
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,483
See, cheater therapy works.

293
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:03,521
Maybe you should've tried
it with Detective Douche.

294
00:12:03,588 --> 00:12:06,824
Or was that what broke you apart?

295
00:12:07,826 --> 00:12:10,233
What is wrong with you lately?

296
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:12,997
I'll look into him.

297
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,899
Thank you.

298
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:16,167
Yeah.

299
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:17,234
Top work, Sherlock.

300
00:12:22,507 --> 00:12:24,175
So I don't understand

301
00:12:24,242 --> 00:12:25,276
all this jealousy talk.

302
00:12:25,343 --> 00:12:28,239
I mean, why covet
something someone else has?

303
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:28,813
Why not just take it?

304
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,714
'Cause it's never that easy.

305
00:12:30,782 --> 00:12:33,017
Well, it is for me.

306
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,985
Usually.

307
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:38,722
I, uh, I may have overstepped

308
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:41,058
earlier in regards to Detective Douche.

309
00:12:41,126 --> 00:12:42,193
Yeah.

310
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,861
You definitely may have.

311
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:48,353
So why did you two separate anyway?

312
00:12:52,804 --> 00:12:55,306
The job was more
important to him than me and Trixie.

313
00:12:55,373 --> 00:12:57,308
But lately something's changed.

314
00:12:57,375 --> 00:13:00,912
He... he makes time for me.

315
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:01,846
He makes time for us.

316
00:13:01,913 --> 00:13:04,315
He's really putting in an effort.

317
00:13:04,382 --> 00:13:06,650
Yes, if ever anyone deserved

318
00:13:06,718 --> 00:13:09,153
a participation trophy, it's Dan.

319
00:13:19,564 --> 00:13:20,598
Decker.

320
00:13:20,665 --> 00:13:21,665
Uh, hello, Detective.

321
00:13:21,733 --> 00:13:22,733
It's about Richard.

322
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:23,801
I wanted to warn you.

323
00:13:23,835 --> 00:13:25,269
He may be unstable.

324
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:26,770
Possibly dangerous.

325
00:13:26,838 --> 00:13:28,305
I'll handle it, but thanks.

326
00:13:28,373 --> 00:13:29,573
I don't mean to you.

327
00:13:29,641 --> 00:13:31,041
I mean to himself.

328
00:13:33,645 --> 00:13:35,980
Yeah, you may be right.

329
00:13:36,047 --> 00:13:37,414
Lucifer?

330
00:13:37,482 --> 00:13:38,816
Oh, my God.

331
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:40,117
There's another one.

332
00:13:40,185 --> 00:13:41,318
Hey, Detective!

333
00:13:41,386 --> 00:13:44,121
You need your roots done!

334
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,143
I've made up my mind.

335
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:58,112
You can't stop me.

336
00:13:58,179 --> 00:13:59,947
What? Oh, no. I'm not here to stop you.

337
00:14:00,014 --> 00:14:01,749
If you want to jump, go for it.

338
00:14:02,984 --> 00:14:06,053
Is this some kind of reverse psychology?

339
00:14:06,121 --> 00:14:07,287
No, quite serious.

340
00:14:07,355 --> 00:14:08,355
Go for it.

341
00:14:08,356 --> 00:14:11,698
Okay, here goes.

342
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:12,926
I do have one
question before you pop off.

343
00:14:12,994 --> 00:14:14,962
You see, I'm trying to
understand jealousy.

344
00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:17,164
It's a new concept to me.

345
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:20,300
And you, dear Ricky, are the
perfect person to explain it.

346
00:14:20,368 --> 00:14:22,603
- What are you talking about...?
- Manners, Ricky.

347
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,570
Manners!

348
00:14:23,638 --> 00:14:24,805
We're not done talking yet!

349
00:14:24,873 --> 00:14:26,206
Okay, I'll talk!!

350
00:14:26,274 --> 00:14:28,008
Pull me back up, please!

351
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,310
Are you sure? Yeah?
'Cause I could just...

352
00:14:30,378 --> 00:14:32,713
Pull me back up!

353
00:14:32,781 --> 00:14:35,048
Pull me up, please!

354
00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:39,520
Oh, God.

355
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,987
I'd save your breath if I were you.

356
00:14:41,022 --> 00:14:43,590
When it comes to this sort
of thing, he's quite judgy.

357
00:14:43,658 --> 00:14:46,226
Right, back to the matter in hand.

358
00:14:46,294 --> 00:14:49,329
Now, you were so jealous that
you murdered Dr. Shaw.

359
00:14:49,397 --> 00:14:50,637
Can you help me understand why?

360
00:14:50,698 --> 00:14:52,966
How could you say that?

361
00:14:53,034 --> 00:14:55,169
I was about to jump, because he's dead.

362
00:14:55,236 --> 00:14:56,603
Don't fib, Rickster.

363
00:14:56,671 --> 00:14:57,805
I know about your death threats.

364
00:14:57,872 --> 00:15:00,674
I was in a bad place.

365
00:15:00,742 --> 00:15:02,276
Kara had just dumped me.

366
00:15:02,343 --> 00:15:03,610
I made my threats.

367
00:15:03,678 --> 00:15:05,145
Then I went to his office...

368
00:15:05,213 --> 00:15:06,547
And killed him.

369
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,048
And he talked me down.

370
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,384
And afterwards, he kept seeing me,

371
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:13,020
even though he knew I
couldn't afford to pay him.

372
00:15:13,087 --> 00:15:15,556
I mean, he'd got me through
my divorce, bankruptcy,

373
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,191
the death of my parrot.

374
00:15:17,258 --> 00:15:20,347
Oh, I've just realized

375
00:15:20,348 --> 00:15:20,794
you're not jealous, are you?

376
00:15:20,862 --> 00:15:22,563
You're just sad.

377
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,298
Pathetic, really.

378
00:15:24,365 --> 00:15:27,734
Well, if you can't
tell me what I need to know,

379
00:15:27,735 --> 00:15:28,368
what good are you?

380
00:15:28,436 --> 00:15:30,871
Aren't you supposed to tell
me that I have a lot to live for?

381
00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:31,939
Well, I wish I could, Ricky,

382
00:15:32,006 --> 00:15:34,241
but your life sounds incredibly bleak.

383
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:37,144
Ironically, it seems
there's nowhere to go but up.

384
00:15:41,716 --> 00:15:43,183
You know what? You're right.

385
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:44,618
Hmm?

386
00:15:44,686 --> 00:15:47,321
Maybe the worst is behind me.

387
00:15:47,388 --> 00:15:48,922
Hmm.

388
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,724
I think I'm ready to go in now.

389
00:15:50,792 --> 00:15:52,392
Well, I wasn't asking, but, uh,

390
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,595
all right, go on, quick as you can.

391
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,563
Come on, chop, chop.

392
00:15:59,734 --> 00:16:01,435
I can't believe you, Lucifer.

393
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:03,203
What? You
should be thanking me.

394
00:16:03,271 --> 00:16:06,807
All right, Richard, we
confirmed your alibi with your neighbor.

395
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,408
You're free to go.

396
00:16:08,476 --> 00:16:10,210
How did this happen?

397
00:16:10,278 --> 00:16:11,678
Poor Sandy.

398
00:16:11,746 --> 00:16:12,646
Who's Sandy?

399
00:16:12,714 --> 00:16:14,815
Dr. Shaw's wife, Alexandra.

400
00:16:14,883 --> 00:16:17,117
Her friends all call her Sandy.

401
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:20,287
Okay, and you're friends with
your therapist's wife?

402
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:23,457
Yes, how open was his
relationship therapy, hmm?

403
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:25,726
No, it's nothing like that.

404
00:16:25,793 --> 00:16:27,394
That's just how the Shaws are.

405
00:16:27,462 --> 00:16:30,097
They go above and beyond.

406
00:16:30,164 --> 00:16:32,332
I just ran into her two days ago.

407
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,301
Sandy was planning a surprise

408
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:36,370
for Dr. Shaw and everything.

409
00:16:36,437 --> 00:16:38,637
You ran into her two days
ago... are you sure about that?

410
00:16:38,673 --> 00:16:39,806
Yeah.

411
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:42,209
Alexandra told us she was in Phoenix.

412
00:16:42,277 --> 00:16:43,176
We checked her alibi.

413
00:16:43,244 --> 00:16:44,344
She had plane tickets to prove it.

414
00:16:44,412 --> 00:16:45,579
What was the surprise?

415
00:16:45,647 --> 00:16:46,980
I don't know.

416
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:49,249
She just asked me not to
tell Dr. Shaw she was in town.

417
00:16:49,317 --> 00:16:51,418
Uh-huh.

418
00:16:51,486 --> 00:16:53,954
You can't think she did this?

419
00:17:07,335 --> 00:17:10,203
We're closed.

420
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,473
You must be Maze.

421
00:17:15,143 --> 00:17:17,311
You're just as Lucifer described.

422
00:17:21,482 --> 00:17:23,750
So, you're the doctor.

423
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:25,252
Oh, call me Linda.

424
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,530
Pleasure to meet you.

425
00:17:34,028 --> 00:17:36,063
I've seen that look in women before.

426
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,497
Won't end well.

427
00:17:37,565 --> 00:17:38,865
What won't?

428
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:40,100
Sleeping with my boss.

429
00:17:40,168 --> 00:17:42,769
You'll end up like all the others.

430
00:17:42,837 --> 00:17:45,339
Trash left by the side of the road.

431
00:17:45,406 --> 00:17:46,840
Interesting.

432
00:17:46,908 --> 00:17:48,075
What?

433
00:17:48,142 --> 00:17:49,443
Well, I find people who are rude

434
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,745
usually feel
powerless in their own lives.

435
00:17:51,813 --> 00:17:54,414
Terrified of not being in control.

436
00:17:54,482 --> 00:17:56,350
But that's not you, I'm sure.

437
00:17:56,417 --> 00:17:58,919
I like you.

438
00:18:00,855 --> 00:18:02,623
Doctor?

439
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,492
What a surprise.

440
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,094
What are you doing here?

441
00:18:07,161 --> 00:18:08,428
I thought you asked me to meet you here.

442
00:18:08,496 --> 00:18:10,330
That-that was me. I felt like

443
00:18:10,398 --> 00:18:13,100
it would be good to get
your input on the case.

444
00:18:13,167 --> 00:18:15,102
That's a good
idea, actually, especially

445
00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:17,371
since our last suspect almost
ended up sidewalk art.

446
00:18:17,438 --> 00:18:19,873
Turns out Mrs. Shaw flew to Phoenix

447
00:18:19,941 --> 00:18:22,509
but rented a car and
drove back a couple days early.

448
00:18:22,577 --> 00:18:24,645
So, dear, sweet Sandy was here

449
00:18:24,712 --> 00:18:26,313
just in time for the murder.

450
00:18:26,381 --> 00:18:29,872
Wait, Alexandra Shaw goes by "Sandy"?

451
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,019
The doctor had a female
patient who was stalked

452
00:18:32,086 --> 00:18:34,788
by someone with the initials S.S.

453
00:18:34,856 --> 00:18:36,523
He used initials in his notes?

454
00:18:36,591 --> 00:18:37,724
I found it odd as well.

455
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:40,527
Why conceal someone's
identity in private notes?

456
00:18:40,595 --> 00:18:43,063
But I thought it wasn't related, so I...

457
00:18:43,131 --> 00:18:46,833
Unless S.S. stands for Sandy Shaw.

458
00:18:46,901 --> 00:18:48,068
If she was stalking

459
00:18:48,136 --> 00:18:50,037
one of her husband's female patients...

460
00:18:50,104 --> 00:18:51,438
Then maybe Dr. Shaw

461
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:53,473
was engaged in his own

462
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:54,608
open-relationship therapy.

463
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:55,876
Sandy found out.

464
00:18:55,943 --> 00:18:57,144
So maybe she wasn't

465
00:18:57,211 --> 00:18:58,245
okay with it as she claimed.

466
00:18:58,312 --> 00:19:00,047
Excuse me.

467
00:19:01,149 --> 00:19:02,482
Decker.

468
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,818
Yeah, this is 831.

469
00:19:04,886 --> 00:19:08,221
Oh, yeah, tell him I'll
be there as soon as I can.

470
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:09,723
Okay, thank you.

471
00:19:10,591 --> 00:19:12,025
That was dispatch.

472
00:19:12,093 --> 00:19:13,160
Dan's phone died,

473
00:19:13,227 --> 00:19:14,628
and he wants me to meet him at my place.

474
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:16,029
Apparently it's urgent.

475
00:19:16,097 --> 00:19:17,264
Oh, how convenient.

476
00:19:17,331 --> 00:19:18,632
What's next... he
spills something on his shirt

477
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,766
and he has to take it off?

478
00:19:19,834 --> 00:19:22,469
Oh, no, the trousers, too.

479
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:24,037
- What?
- What, so that's it?

480
00:19:24,105 --> 00:19:25,705
You just go running
as soon as Dan calls?

481
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,973
What about the case?

482
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,961
This could relate to
another case I'm working on.

483
00:19:28,976 --> 00:19:30,744
There's units looking for Sandy now.

484
00:19:30,812 --> 00:19:32,412
And once they find her, they'll call me.

485
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,914
Bye.

486
00:19:33,981 --> 00:19:34,981
Bye.

487
00:19:35,016 --> 00:19:36,249
Unbelievable.

488
00:19:36,317 --> 00:19:38,077
You see what I'm
dealing with now, don't you?

489
00:19:38,086 --> 00:19:41,521
I think I do, actually.

490
00:19:41,589 --> 00:19:43,957
It's worse than I realized.

491
00:19:44,025 --> 00:19:46,259
Thank you.

492
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,635
Hey, Dan.

493
00:19:55,703 --> 00:19:57,504
What did you find out?

494
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:58,939
Surprise.

495
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,429
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hey! I just wanted to talk.

496
00:20:11,497 --> 00:20:14,214
You act all chummy in public,

497
00:20:14,215 --> 00:20:15,368
then you break into my home,

498
00:20:15,369 --> 00:20:16,601
trick me into meeting you in private?

499
00:20:16,668 --> 00:20:19,437
Excuse me if I'm not trusting.

500
00:20:19,505 --> 00:20:21,739
Hey, I'm not armed.

501
00:20:21,807 --> 00:20:24,041
All right? Hey.

502
00:20:25,277 --> 00:20:27,979
Huh? It's nothing like that.

503
00:20:29,515 --> 00:20:31,672
All right.

504
00:20:32,618 --> 00:20:34,285
Then talk.

505
00:20:34,353 --> 00:20:36,421
I had to meet with you where
no one else could hear.

506
00:20:36,488 --> 00:20:38,089
Hear what... my screams?

507
00:20:39,024 --> 00:20:42,126
Decker, we're on the same side.

508
00:20:42,194 --> 00:20:43,861
And I know you're
still looking into Palmetto.

509
00:20:43,929 --> 00:20:45,797
Well, guess what? So am I.

510
00:20:45,864 --> 00:20:47,632
I put that to bed a long time ago.

511
00:20:47,699 --> 00:20:49,200
That the best you got?

512
00:20:49,268 --> 00:20:52,437
God, you're a decent cop, but
you are a terrible liar.

513
00:20:52,504 --> 00:20:54,672
Come on!

514
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,940
Palmetto stinks.

515
00:20:56,008 --> 00:20:57,375
I should know. I was there.

516
00:20:57,443 --> 00:20:59,243
Mm-hmm.

517
00:20:59,311 --> 00:21:01,412
Go ahead, say it.

518
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,047
I look dirty.

519
00:21:03,115 --> 00:21:05,516
I saw you meet with Nikolas Aoudi.

520
00:21:05,584 --> 00:21:07,285
You were laughing.

521
00:21:07,352 --> 00:21:08,920
I saw you hand him cash.

522
00:21:08,987 --> 00:21:10,855
I've used him as a CI before.

523
00:21:10,923 --> 00:21:12,957
I was buying information.

524
00:21:13,025 --> 00:21:16,194
Then we both got shot.

525
00:21:16,261 --> 00:21:19,784
And I think it was a cop who shot me.

526
00:21:20,866 --> 00:21:22,733
But you knew that already, didn't you?

527
00:21:22,801 --> 00:21:24,068
Why do you think it was a cop?

528
00:21:24,136 --> 00:21:25,770
That's what I was paying Aoudi for.

529
00:21:25,838 --> 00:21:27,839
Intel on someone crooked at our station.

530
00:21:27,906 --> 00:21:29,874
But I think he or she got to me first.

531
00:21:29,942 --> 00:21:31,609
That's...

532
00:21:31,677 --> 00:21:33,177
that's a great story.

533
00:21:33,245 --> 00:21:34,345
I love the ending.

534
00:21:34,413 --> 00:21:36,414
It-it ties up all the loose ends.

535
00:21:36,482 --> 00:21:37,748
Not really.

536
00:21:37,816 --> 00:21:39,217
I can't explain

537
00:21:39,284 --> 00:21:42,787
how the crooked cop knew I was there.

538
00:21:43,889 --> 00:21:45,690
How'd you find me?

539
00:21:45,757 --> 00:21:47,492
I followed the smell.

540
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:48,799
You followed the...

541
00:21:48,861 --> 00:21:50,261
You know what?

542
00:21:50,329 --> 00:21:51,662
Screw this.

543
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:53,231
I only called you to try and help.

544
00:21:53,298 --> 00:21:54,165
Really?

545
00:21:54,233 --> 00:21:55,833
Yeah, really.

546
00:21:55,901 --> 00:21:58,436
Listen, Decker, they
pulled the plug on me.

547
00:21:58,504 --> 00:22:01,639
Malcolm...

548
00:22:01,707 --> 00:22:03,274
I was dead.

549
00:22:03,342 --> 00:22:05,443
I-I know.

550
00:22:05,511 --> 00:22:09,614
Made me appreciate the
time I've got here.

551
00:22:09,681 --> 00:22:11,682
So, personally, I don't think

552
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:15,186
I'm gonna dig any deeper on this one.

553
00:22:15,254 --> 00:22:17,188
And I wouldn't if I were you either.

554
00:22:17,256 --> 00:22:19,924
Not sure if that's a
warning or a threat.

555
00:22:19,992 --> 00:22:22,627
I'm not the enemy, Chloe.

556
00:22:22,694 --> 00:22:24,795
But whoever we were investigating,

557
00:22:24,863 --> 00:22:27,064
they're still out there.

558
00:22:27,132 --> 00:22:30,957
And they clearly don't
have a problem shooting cops.

559
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,244
Decker.

560
00:22:41,313 --> 00:22:42,813
Unis found Sandy Shaw

561
00:22:42,881 --> 00:22:44,315
in her car in a parking structure.

562
00:22:44,383 --> 00:22:45,750
Oh, well, I hope our case

563
00:22:45,817 --> 00:22:48,052
didn't ruin your kissy-time with Dan.

564
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,421
What is with your recent obsession
with my love life?

565
00:22:50,489 --> 00:22:51,756
Obsession?

566
00:22:51,823 --> 00:22:53,291
That's awfully defensive.

567
00:22:53,358 --> 00:22:55,526
Probably indicates deeper
issues, wouldn't you say?

568
00:22:55,594 --> 00:22:56,594
I agree.

569
00:22:56,628 --> 00:22:59,864
Why are you so defensive, Lucifer?

570
00:22:59,932 --> 00:23:01,532
Good question.

571
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,935
Et tu, Doctor?

572
00:23:04,002 --> 00:23:06,103
Lucifer, you asked me
to analyze the situation.

573
00:23:06,171 --> 00:23:08,873
No, I asked you to help
figure out what's wrong with her.

574
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,142
Did you now?

575
00:23:11,209 --> 00:23:12,209
But...

576
00:23:12,244 --> 00:23:14,078
Nothing's wrong with her.

577
00:23:14,146 --> 00:23:16,514
She's a woman balancing
a lot on her plate,

578
00:23:16,582 --> 00:23:19,684
and, as far as I can
tell, doing a fantastic job.

579
00:23:19,751 --> 00:23:21,285
Why, thank you.

580
00:23:21,353 --> 00:23:23,554
You're right, Lucifer, she's amazing.

581
00:23:23,622 --> 00:23:24,755
No, she's verbal Ebola.

582
00:23:24,823 --> 00:23:26,390
Where's the button to put the glass up?

583
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:28,693
This isn't a limo, Lucifer.

584
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,760
And, Dr. Linda,

585
00:23:29,795 --> 00:23:31,696
you should really join us more often.

586
00:23:33,165 --> 00:23:35,700
Getting double-teamed is usually
much more fun than this.

587
00:23:35,767 --> 00:23:37,068
Mm.

588
00:23:37,135 --> 00:23:38,202
Gross.

589
00:23:40,973 --> 00:23:42,173
So you lied to us.

590
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,941
You were in town the
day your husband died.

591
00:23:44,009 --> 00:23:46,644
Yes. But it's not what you think.

592
00:23:46,712 --> 00:23:48,245
Okay, then help me understand.

593
00:23:48,313 --> 00:23:50,848
Sandy, I'm on your side.

594
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:52,483
Not everything stems from jealousy,

595
00:23:52,551 --> 00:23:54,150
no matter what these women tell you.

596
00:23:54,175 --> 00:23:54,909
Hey, Lucifer...

597
00:23:54,953 --> 00:23:58,022
You came here driven by some
kind of desire, didn't you?

598
00:23:58,090 --> 00:23:59,223
No.

599
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:00,057
Come on.

600
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:02,259
You can tell me. What was it?

601
00:24:03,829 --> 00:24:05,296
It's disgusting.

602
00:24:05,364 --> 00:24:06,831
Ooh, you naughty girl.

603
00:24:06,898 --> 00:24:08,666
Come on, now you have to tell me.

604
00:24:08,734 --> 00:24:12,136
It's... in my car.

605
00:24:13,205 --> 00:24:15,406
What is, Sandy?

606
00:24:15,474 --> 00:24:16,240
Poop.

607
00:24:16,308 --> 00:24:18,242
Oh.

608
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,744
Bags and bags of it.

609
00:24:19,811 --> 00:24:21,979
Oh, my God.

610
00:24:25,484 --> 00:24:27,885
I'm not sure whether to
be horrified or impressed.

611
00:24:27,953 --> 00:24:29,520
My friend owns a horse.

612
00:24:29,588 --> 00:24:32,590
That's oddly comforting to know.

613
00:24:32,658 --> 00:24:34,525
What were you gonna do with it?

614
00:24:34,593 --> 00:24:36,427
I was going to throw it at Tiffany.

615
00:24:36,495 --> 00:24:37,361
That's the patient

616
00:24:37,429 --> 00:24:40,564
you were accused of... Stalking.

617
00:24:40,632 --> 00:24:42,066
Yeah.

618
00:24:42,134 --> 00:24:44,001
She's in a group
therapy session right now

619
00:24:44,069 --> 00:24:45,503
for my husband's clients.

620
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:46,637
Group cheater therapy.

621
00:24:46,705 --> 00:24:48,506
Oh, the imagination runs wild.

622
00:24:48,573 --> 00:24:50,107
So Tiffany was sleeping
with your husband.

623
00:24:50,175 --> 00:24:51,242
She was.

624
00:24:51,309 --> 00:24:52,476
How'd you find out?

625
00:24:52,544 --> 00:24:55,212
My husband's
colleague, Dr. Medina, called me.

626
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,348
Okay, so he told you that
your husband was cheating?

627
00:24:57,416 --> 00:24:59,183
No, he had no idea.

628
00:24:59,251 --> 00:25:00,251
He just called to see

629
00:25:00,318 --> 00:25:02,420
if Bernie wanted to
grab a last-minute drink.

630
00:25:02,487 --> 00:25:05,256
But Bernie was supposed to
already be with Dr. Medina.

631
00:25:05,323 --> 00:25:07,558
That's when I knew my
husband lied to me.

632
00:25:07,626 --> 00:25:09,126
But he was the cheater therapist.

633
00:25:09,194 --> 00:25:10,828
I don't quite see the problem here.

634
00:25:10,896 --> 00:25:12,029
I mean, you said yourself...

635
00:25:12,097 --> 00:25:14,031
The problem is he fell in love with her.

636
00:25:16,735 --> 00:25:18,502
I lied to him about my trip,

637
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:22,673
then I drove back from
Phoenix to see what he was doing.

638
00:25:22,741 --> 00:25:23,808
I was...

639
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:25,042
Don't say it.

640
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:25,743
Jealous.

641
00:25:25,811 --> 00:25:27,111
Yes, yes, we all get it!

642
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:28,512
Jealousy makes the world go...

643
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,314
I mean, what are you, a girl band?

644
00:25:30,382 --> 00:25:31,482
I loved him.

645
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,550
Oh...

646
00:25:32,551 --> 00:25:33,718
I didn't kill him.

647
00:25:33,785 --> 00:25:35,920
I just wanted him back.

648
00:25:37,422 --> 00:25:38,823
Oh, great.

649
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:41,620
- The douche-mobile.
- Give me a second.

650
00:25:44,129 --> 00:25:45,796
Hey, I got your text. You okay?

651
00:25:45,864 --> 00:25:47,198
Did Malcolm hurt you?

652
00:25:47,265 --> 00:25:48,933
No. I told you, it's-it's fine.

653
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,702
Everything's fine.

654
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:54,438
I'm gonna punch that son of a
bitch right back into a coma.

655
00:25:54,506 --> 00:25:55,506
Oh, come on.

656
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,441
No. No.

657
00:25:57,509 --> 00:25:58,876
Anything back on the 999 key?

658
00:25:58,944 --> 00:26:01,078
I'm sorry, Chloe.

659
00:26:01,146 --> 00:26:03,247
They couldn't get any prints off of it.

660
00:26:05,283 --> 00:26:07,151
Thanks.

661
00:26:07,219 --> 00:26:09,153
So that's Dan, huh?

662
00:26:09,221 --> 00:26:10,254
Yes.

663
00:26:10,322 --> 00:26:13,224
Numbingly average, isn't he?

664
00:26:13,291 --> 00:26:14,658
I wouldn't say that.

665
00:26:14,726 --> 00:26:18,062
What... You're supposed
to be on my side, you know.

666
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:21,365
No. I'm supposed to help
you process your emotions

667
00:26:21,433 --> 00:26:23,300
so you can deal with
them constructively.

668
00:26:23,368 --> 00:26:27,238
Yes, by being on my side and
realizing that I'm right.

669
00:26:27,305 --> 00:26:28,539
Lucifer...

670
00:26:28,607 --> 00:26:31,041
Is over this conversation.

671
00:26:31,109 --> 00:26:32,409
I'm gonna go and talk

672
00:26:32,477 --> 00:26:36,881
to some people who are a
little more open-minded, Doctor.

673
00:26:43,188 --> 00:26:46,257
Hi. I'm Dr. Medina.
Thank you for coming.

674
00:26:46,324 --> 00:26:48,192
All right, looks like we have everyone,

675
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,493
so let's start.

676
00:26:49,561 --> 00:26:50,728
Yes! That's a great idea.

677
00:26:50,796 --> 00:26:52,196
There's so very much to discuss.

678
00:26:52,264 --> 00:26:55,332
So let's start with the
most important thing, shall we?

679
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,683
Me.

680
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:11,705
And once again,

681
00:27:11,772 --> 00:27:13,807
Lucifer disappears.

682
00:27:13,874 --> 00:27:17,477
I think the case may have
hit a little too close to home.

683
00:27:17,545 --> 00:27:18,612
Maybe things got a little too boring

684
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:20,380
for Mr. Short Attention Span.

685
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,681
I don't know.

686
00:27:21,749 --> 00:27:23,783
He's grown quite a bit
since working with you.

687
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:26,419
I'm not sure I'm the reason.

688
00:27:26,487 --> 00:27:28,088
I think you've really helped him.

689
00:27:28,155 --> 00:27:30,390
I underestimated you before. I'm sorry.

690
00:27:30,458 --> 00:27:32,325
Not needed. But thank you.

691
00:27:32,393 --> 00:27:33,893
And I thought...

692
00:27:33,961 --> 00:27:35,595
I thought you were sleeping with him.

693
00:27:35,663 --> 00:27:37,163
Oh, I am.

694
00:27:37,231 --> 00:27:38,865
Oh. Oh.

695
00:27:40,434 --> 00:27:41,868
Is, um... is that...?

696
00:27:41,936 --> 00:27:42,535
Ethical?

697
00:27:42,603 --> 00:27:44,137
- Mm-hmm.
- No.

698
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:46,406
No, it is not.

699
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:50,210
But there's something about him.

700
00:27:50,278 --> 00:27:52,078
I can't stop myself.

701
00:27:55,283 --> 00:27:56,916
But I think it's time I did.

702
00:27:58,486 --> 00:28:00,887
I mean, even I'm starting to feel...

703
00:28:04,292 --> 00:28:06,793
So do you think she did it?

704
00:28:06,861 --> 00:28:10,463
Sandy claims she was sitting
outside Tiffany's house,

705
00:28:10,531 --> 00:28:12,399
waiting for Dr. Shaw to show up.

706
00:28:12,466 --> 00:28:14,834
Problem is, no one
can corroborate her alibi.

707
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:17,103
But, no, I don't think it was her.

708
00:28:17,171 --> 00:28:20,473
So there's no one in Dr.
Shaw's files that looked like

709
00:28:20,541 --> 00:28:21,741
a potential suspect?

710
00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:23,943
Not that I can tell, but
maybe I missed something.

711
00:28:24,011 --> 00:28:25,345
What?

712
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:28,081
The cheater therapist turned out
to be terrible at cheating.

713
00:28:28,149 --> 00:28:31,418
Why didn't he tell Dr. Medina
he was using him as a cover story?

714
00:28:31,485 --> 00:28:32,719
Maybe he did.

715
00:28:32,787 --> 00:28:34,721
Maybe he confided in Dr. Medina.

716
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:36,456
But Mrs. Shaw said that Dr. Medina

717
00:28:36,524 --> 00:28:38,291
had no idea about the affair.

718
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:39,559
Yeah, so he conveniently told her

719
00:28:39,627 --> 00:28:41,467
everything she needed
to know to figure it out.

720
00:28:42,563 --> 00:28:43,930
We need to talk to Dr. Medina.

721
00:28:43,998 --> 00:28:46,499
Which brings us to today,

722
00:28:46,567 --> 00:28:48,902
where we find Mrs. Shaw

723
00:28:48,969 --> 00:28:50,937
with a bag of excrement in her boot.

724
00:28:51,005 --> 00:28:52,138
Sorry, trunk.

725
00:28:52,206 --> 00:28:54,140
And somehow, out of all that,

726
00:28:54,208 --> 00:28:56,509
they've decided that I'm jealous.

727
00:28:57,578 --> 00:28:59,813
So... what do you think?

728
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,880
Huh?

729
00:29:00,915 --> 00:29:01,715
Yes.

730
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:03,083
So, wait, you're the Devil?

731
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,284
Yes, yes.

732
00:29:04,352 --> 00:29:06,119
Please keep up. Anyone. You.

733
00:29:06,187 --> 00:29:08,121
When you say you, uh, burned your wings,

734
00:29:08,189 --> 00:29:09,189
was that a metaphor...?

735
00:29:09,223 --> 00:29:11,024
Not focusing on the right details!

736
00:29:11,092 --> 00:29:12,759
Uh, yeah.

737
00:29:12,827 --> 00:29:14,094
She was gonna throw poop at me?

738
00:29:14,161 --> 00:29:15,795
God, this isn't about you, Tiffany.

739
00:29:15,863 --> 00:29:16,930
All right?

740
00:29:16,997 --> 00:29:18,998
Huh, no wonder you're all in therapy.

741
00:29:19,066 --> 00:29:22,268
All right, this is supposed
to be a grief therapy session

742
00:29:22,336 --> 00:29:23,603
for the patients of Dr. Shaw.

743
00:29:23,671 --> 00:29:27,107
And everyone here has a
terrible loss to deal with.

744
00:29:27,174 --> 00:29:28,241
What, and I don't?

745
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:30,410
I've lost both my
therapist and my partner.

746
00:29:30,478 --> 00:29:32,178
I'm s...

747
00:29:32,246 --> 00:29:33,246
Th-They died?

748
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,514
No. No, they turned on me.

749
00:29:34,582 --> 00:29:35,615
Some would argue that's worse.

750
00:29:35,683 --> 00:29:36,850
All right, you need to leave.

751
00:29:36,917 --> 00:29:39,452
No, I'm close to
something. I can feel it.

752
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,187
This is not about you!

753
00:29:41,255 --> 00:29:42,722
Gah.

754
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:45,125
You're right.

755
00:29:45,126 --> 00:29:46,359
Yes.

756
00:29:46,427 --> 00:29:48,361
I should use one of you as a case study.

757
00:29:48,429 --> 00:29:49,529
Thank you for volunteering.

758
00:29:49,597 --> 00:29:51,598
So what...

759
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:54,134
what makes you jealous? Hmm?

760
00:29:54,201 --> 00:29:58,071
What do you desire that you can't have?

761
00:29:58,139 --> 00:29:59,139
Come on.

762
00:30:00,207 --> 00:30:01,341
I...

763
00:30:01,409 --> 00:30:02,475
Yeah?

764
00:30:02,543 --> 00:30:04,644
I want Sandy.

765
00:30:06,213 --> 00:30:07,947
What?

766
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:10,083
Oh.

767
00:30:10,151 --> 00:30:12,552
I remember you now.

768
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:15,121
Tissue Lad!

769
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:18,291
Wanted some open relationship therapy
of your own, is that it?

770
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:19,826
That's not what it is like.

771
00:30:19,894 --> 00:30:21,561
But she didn't want you, did she?

772
00:30:21,629 --> 00:30:23,496
Sandy loved her husband,

773
00:30:23,564 --> 00:30:26,332
so you killed him, didn't you?

774
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,233
Shut up!

775
00:30:27,301 --> 00:30:28,334
Solved it, haven't I?

776
00:30:28,402 --> 00:30:30,069
Eh?! Haven't I?

777
00:30:31,572 --> 00:30:32,572
So that's a yes.

778
00:30:32,573 --> 00:30:33,940
He's got a knife!

779
00:30:34,008 --> 00:30:36,276
Do you realize what you've done?

780
00:30:36,343 --> 00:30:38,077
I had to kill him, all right?

781
00:30:38,145 --> 00:30:40,380
He lied to her. He cheated on her.

782
00:30:40,448 --> 00:30:43,416
And I tried to tip her
off, but no matter what he did,

783
00:30:43,484 --> 00:30:44,517
she still loved him.

784
00:30:44,585 --> 00:30:45,652
No, no, not that.

785
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:47,153
This. Right here.

786
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:50,657
You've just given me the
perfect example of unbridled jealousy.

787
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:52,992
I'm not jealous. I'm not.

788
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,662
The woman that you
loved was with someone else,

789
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:57,897
someone you thought
wasn't worthy of her.

790
00:30:57,965 --> 00:31:01,000
But no matter what you did...

791
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:03,603
she never saw you the
way you wanted her to.

792
00:31:03,671 --> 00:31:06,272
That's...

793
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,874
That's pretty accurate.

794
00:31:07,942 --> 00:31:09,609
Yeah.

795
00:31:09,677 --> 00:31:11,544
You've just made me realize something.

796
00:31:12,813 --> 00:31:16,349
That my situation and yours are...

797
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:18,852
absolutely nothing alike.

798
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:20,720
I was right! Not jealous!

799
00:31:20,788 --> 00:31:22,355
Drop your weapon!

800
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:26,960
- Ow!
- Ooh.

801
00:31:31,165 --> 00:31:32,465
Did you seriously

802
00:31:32,533 --> 00:31:34,067
just bite me?

803
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:36,603
He's the killer.

804
00:31:38,072 --> 00:31:40,373
Yeah, you think?

805
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:02,328
So you were right about Linda.

806
00:32:02,396 --> 00:32:03,863
She helped me figure out the motive.

807
00:32:03,931 --> 00:32:07,600
And then I realized
Jonathan and Dr. Shaw's offices

808
00:32:07,668 --> 00:32:09,335
shared the same security system.

809
00:32:09,403 --> 00:32:10,537
So I checked and...

810
00:32:10,604 --> 00:32:12,939
You're not listening to me, are you?

811
00:32:15,042 --> 00:32:17,477
Afraid not.

812
00:32:18,579 --> 00:32:19,746
You didn't see any similarity

813
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:21,548
between yourself and Jonathan?

814
00:32:21,615 --> 00:32:24,317
So you heard some of that, did you?

815
00:32:24,385 --> 00:32:25,985
Tail end.

816
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:31,357
I don't know.

817
00:32:31,425 --> 00:32:32,592
Did you?

818
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:36,262
Mm-mm. No.

819
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,764
Completely different.

820
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:40,800
That's what I thought.

821
00:32:42,069 --> 00:32:45,939
So... how's your secret
case with Dan going?

822
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:47,206
Secretly terrible.

823
00:32:47,274 --> 00:32:48,508
Do you remember Malcolm?

824
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:50,543
Coma boy?

825
00:32:51,445 --> 00:32:52,579
He woke up.

826
00:32:52,646 --> 00:32:54,047
He claims he's innocent.

827
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:58,585
Something he said bothers me.

828
00:32:58,652 --> 00:33:00,153
Whoever shot him knew about Palmetto,

829
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:02,655
but he says that no one should
have known he was there.

830
00:33:02,723 --> 00:33:04,824
Well, you found him there.

831
00:33:04,892 --> 00:33:07,160
Yeah, I... He pointed that out, too.

832
00:33:07,227 --> 00:33:09,896
So, whoever followed him could
have done what I did.

833
00:33:09,964 --> 00:33:11,698
So how did you track him?

834
00:33:11,765 --> 00:33:14,167
Partners on the force share
GPS locators in their gear

835
00:33:14,234 --> 00:33:16,436
so that they can find
each other in emergencies.

836
00:33:16,503 --> 00:33:19,639
You hacked his partner's locator.

837
00:33:19,707 --> 00:33:21,708
Which means...

838
00:33:21,775 --> 00:33:24,243
Malcolm's partner
knew he was there, too.

839
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,814
Tony Paolucci knew.

840
00:33:48,102 --> 00:33:51,170
That's Paolucci's car,
just like his GPS said.

841
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:52,338
But the bar's closed.

842
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:55,541
Maybe he decided to
keep the party going.

843
00:34:03,584 --> 00:34:05,385
You have to stop doing that.

844
00:34:05,452 --> 00:34:07,120
It was unlocked.

845
00:34:17,564 --> 00:34:19,866
Paolucci, you in here?

846
00:34:47,795 --> 00:34:50,129
At least you can see
what he was thinking.

847
00:35:03,678 --> 00:35:05,546
Dan.

848
00:35:10,385 --> 00:35:12,352
I found a suicide note.

849
00:35:13,254 --> 00:35:14,555
In his handwriting?

850
00:35:15,423 --> 00:35:16,790
Sure looks like it.

851
00:35:16,858 --> 00:35:18,759
Apparently, he was on the take.

852
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:21,195
Malcolm was onto
him, so Paolucci shot him.

853
00:35:21,262 --> 00:35:22,596
When Malcolm woke up,

854
00:35:22,664 --> 00:35:24,565
Paolucci couldn't
take the guilt anymore.

855
00:35:31,139 --> 00:35:32,506
You okay?

856
00:35:33,374 --> 00:35:34,675
Paolucci was an ass,

857
00:35:34,742 --> 00:35:37,978
but this... I can't imagine this.

858
00:35:38,046 --> 00:35:39,846
I know.

859
00:35:39,914 --> 00:35:41,648
I know.

860
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:02,069
Uh, come in.

861
00:36:02,136 --> 00:36:03,704
Hello, Doctor.

862
00:36:06,941 --> 00:36:08,242
Thank you for coming.

863
00:36:08,309 --> 00:36:12,012
Uh, I know we're not due for
a session for a few days.

864
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,480
No, my bad.

865
00:36:13,548 --> 00:36:16,216
I realize I'm not up to date
on my payments, so...

866
00:36:17,585 --> 00:36:19,253
Uh...

867
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,354
don't.

868
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:24,591
What's wrong? Nothing's wrong.

869
00:36:24,659 --> 00:36:26,493
I realized a few things.

870
00:36:26,561 --> 00:36:29,196
As I said,

871
00:36:29,264 --> 00:36:32,699
we made a breakthrough.

872
00:36:32,767 --> 00:36:37,037
And I think, with that in mind,

873
00:36:37,105 --> 00:36:39,506
we should keep our
relationship professional from now on.

874
00:36:39,574 --> 00:36:40,641
Oh.

875
00:36:40,708 --> 00:36:41,775
Are you sure?

876
00:36:41,843 --> 00:36:43,810
Very much so.

877
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,513
Very well.

878
00:36:46,581 --> 00:36:49,149
If, uh... if you think it's best.

879
00:36:49,217 --> 00:36:50,217
I do.

880
00:36:50,218 --> 00:36:51,551
Right.

881
00:36:51,619 --> 00:36:55,989
Well, I'll, um... see
you at my next session, then.

882
00:37:05,366 --> 00:37:07,234
- One last thing before I go.
- Yes?

883
00:37:07,302 --> 00:37:10,170
Dr. Canaan down the
hall... what's he like?

884
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:13,340
Uh, thoughtful.

885
00:37:13,408 --> 00:37:15,442
Spiritual. Why?

886
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,344
Little sanctimonious?

887
00:37:17,412 --> 00:37:19,146
I don't know. I suppose.

888
00:37:19,213 --> 00:37:21,748
Six-foot-two,
black, voice like an angel?

889
00:37:21,816 --> 00:37:23,150
Oh, you know him.

890
00:37:25,687 --> 00:37:27,954
All too well.

891
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,694
Trixie's finally down.

892
00:37:33,761 --> 00:37:35,996
She conned
you into reading the book

893
00:37:36,064 --> 00:37:38,198
about the sneezing panda, didn't she?

894
00:37:38,266 --> 00:37:39,900
Five times.

895
00:37:45,573 --> 00:37:48,208
Hey. Um...

896
00:37:48,276 --> 00:37:49,976
thank you.

897
00:37:51,212 --> 00:37:52,279
For what?

898
00:37:52,347 --> 00:37:56,683
You know, for having my back and...

899
00:37:56,751 --> 00:37:58,051
for everything.

900
00:38:06,394 --> 00:38:07,994
You're welcome.

901
00:38:09,464 --> 00:38:10,664
For everything.

902
00:38:24,579 --> 00:38:26,880
You should go.

903
00:38:28,383 --> 00:38:29,750
Yeah, I should.

904
00:38:29,817 --> 00:38:31,885
I'm sorry.

905
00:38:31,953 --> 00:38:34,755
No. Don't be sorry.

906
00:39:00,381 --> 00:39:02,249
All right.

907
00:39:02,316 --> 00:39:04,017
Okay.

908
00:39:04,085 --> 00:39:05,318
Bye.

909
00:39:24,906 --> 00:39:27,040
Evening, Dan.

910
00:39:29,277 --> 00:39:31,211
I got your text.

911
00:39:31,279 --> 00:39:33,079
What do you want?

912
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:38,251
Just wanted to congratulate
you on closing Palmetto.

913
00:39:38,319 --> 00:39:40,921
You and that smart, sexy lady of yours

914
00:39:40,988 --> 00:39:42,889
caught the guy who shot me.

915
00:39:45,693 --> 00:39:48,228
That's what the confession said, right?

916
00:39:49,297 --> 00:39:52,799
How long did it take you to write it?

917
00:39:54,202 --> 00:39:56,570
Forever. I mean, I'm so not a word guy.

918
00:39:56,637 --> 00:39:58,839
You know?

919
00:39:58,906 --> 00:40:01,575
What? You should be thanking me.

920
00:40:01,642 --> 00:40:03,276
Why is that?

921
00:40:03,344 --> 00:40:06,680
Well, I could have
told everyone the truth...

922
00:40:06,747 --> 00:40:09,082
that you shot me.

923
00:40:09,951 --> 00:40:11,284
Why didn't you?

924
00:40:19,093 --> 00:40:20,594
'Cause I like you.

925
00:40:20,661 --> 00:40:24,498
And I can't imagine what
would happen to your life

926
00:40:24,565 --> 00:40:27,000
if people found out the truth.

927
00:40:27,068 --> 00:40:28,668
Your colleagues, your ex...

928
00:40:28,736 --> 00:40:31,338
- I swear to God, I will...
- What? Shoot me?

929
00:40:31,405 --> 00:40:33,173
Ah, been there, done that.

930
00:40:33,241 --> 00:40:35,208
Big fail.

931
00:40:35,276 --> 00:40:38,144
Besides, you wouldn't want anything

932
00:40:38,212 --> 00:40:39,913
to mess with your pretty little family

933
00:40:39,981 --> 00:40:42,415
now that you're
working to fix things, right?

934
00:40:43,417 --> 00:40:45,051
Whatever you want to do to me,

935
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:46,720
- you keep them out of it.
- Dan.

936
00:40:48,122 --> 00:40:49,923
Come on.

937
00:40:49,991 --> 00:40:51,691
I'm not gonna hurt anyone.

938
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,227
No.

939
00:40:54,295 --> 00:40:56,029
No, no, no, no, no.

940
00:40:56,097 --> 00:40:58,431
You... you and I...

941
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,434
we're gonna be best friends.

942
00:41:01,502 --> 00:41:02,769
Yeah.

943
00:41:02,837 --> 00:41:05,472
Because I got big plans for you.

944
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,040
Big plans.

945
00:41:09,343 --> 00:41:11,311
Fun, right?

946
00:41:11,379 --> 00:41:13,580
We're having fun now.

947
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:51,384
I just learned the strangest thing.

948
00:41:51,452 --> 00:41:55,255
Spoiler alert, Amenadiel
found Dr. Linda.

949
00:41:55,323 --> 00:41:58,558
He was an angel on her
shoulder, trying to control me.

950
00:41:58,626 --> 00:42:01,161
I wonder how my dear, angelic brother

951
00:42:01,228 --> 00:42:03,763
got such a wickedly clever idea.

952
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,867
I did it to protect you.

953
00:42:07,935 --> 00:42:09,269
I told you,

954
00:42:09,337 --> 00:42:11,805
whatever the danger, I'll
be there to stop it.

955
00:42:11,872 --> 00:42:13,673
Whether you see it coming or not.

956
00:42:13,741 --> 00:42:15,609
You betrayed me, Maze.

957
00:42:16,644 --> 00:42:18,244
And not for my own good.

958
00:42:18,312 --> 00:42:20,080
You did it for yourself.

959
00:42:21,649 --> 00:42:24,851
Who is this human world really
rubbing off on, eh?

960
00:42:24,919 --> 00:42:26,886
Me or you?

961
00:42:27,788 --> 00:42:29,089
- Lucifer, I...
- Ah.

962
00:42:29,156 --> 00:42:31,458
Don't want to hear it.

963
00:42:31,525 --> 00:42:34,427
'Cause you and me, we're done.

Thank you for having my
back and for everything.

I could have told everyone the truth.

4
00:00:09,115 --> 00:00:10,115
You shot me.

Why didn't you?

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,366
It seems I'm dealing with a bit

11
00:00:20,434 --> 00:00:21,233
of a mortality sitch.

12
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:22,702
I'm bleeding.

13
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:24,503
I'm just realizing the gravity
of what you're saying.

14
00:00:24,571 --> 00:00:26,906
That I'm allergic to lead projectiles?

15
00:00:26,974 --> 00:00:27,974
All I have to do

16
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:29,842
is wait for some pitiful thug

17
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,444
to end you.

18
00:00:31,511 --> 00:00:33,779
And right back to Hell you go.

19
00:00:33,847 --> 00:00:35,748
People come to me to ask for
favors, and more often than not,

20
00:00:35,816 --> 00:00:37,450
- I'm happy to oblige.
- What do you get?

21
00:00:37,517 --> 00:00:38,651
A devilish I.O.U., if you will.

22
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:39,752
Who would take a deal like that?

23
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,421
They all do.

24
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:00,673
Yeah, fantastic!

25
00:01:00,741 --> 00:01:02,141
You're here.

26
00:01:06,647 --> 00:01:08,881
Ah, starving! Can't think why!

27
00:01:08,949 --> 00:01:10,816
Okay.

28
00:01:10,884 --> 00:01:12,284
Thank you.

29
00:01:12,352 --> 00:01:13,986
Uh, this should, uh,

30
00:01:14,054 --> 00:01:15,621
well, this should just about cover it.

31
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:18,424
Have a nice evening.

32
00:01:18,492 --> 00:01:20,393
Oh, curious.

33
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,962
In your line of work, how many
times has it happened to you?

34
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,398
You know, like in those
wonderful Internet videos?

35
00:01:26,633 --> 00:01:28,434
Your deliveries ending in sex.

36
00:01:28,502 --> 00:01:30,569
Uh...

37
00:01:30,637 --> 00:01:31,604
never.

38
00:01:31,672 --> 00:01:33,739
Well, that changes tonight.

39
00:01:33,807 --> 00:01:34,940
Come!

40
00:01:36,076 --> 00:01:37,443
Come on! Come, come!

41
00:01:37,511 --> 00:01:39,078
Come.

42
00:01:39,146 --> 00:01:40,112
I'm still on the clock.

43
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,614
Oh, you'll always be on the clock.

44
00:01:41,682 --> 00:01:44,116
But how often will you be here?

45
00:01:44,184 --> 00:01:45,851
Hey? Oh, Brittanies!

46
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:47,053
Brittanies,

47
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,254
- Yeah!
- Pizza delivery guy.

48
00:01:48,321 --> 00:01:50,456
Pizza delivery guy, Brittanies.

49
00:01:50,524 --> 00:01:52,258
Hi!

50
00:01:52,325 --> 00:01:54,026
Well, go on.

51
00:01:54,094 --> 00:01:55,361
What are you waiting for?

52
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:57,496
- Have fun.
- Come on!

53
00:01:57,564 --> 00:01:59,865
Lucifer!

54
00:01:59,933 --> 00:02:01,067
Come join us.

55
00:02:01,134 --> 00:02:02,668
Be right there, darlings.

56
00:02:02,736 --> 00:02:04,003
All right.

57
00:02:09,843 --> 00:02:11,110
But I didn't

58
00:02:11,178 --> 00:02:12,678
join them.

59
00:02:12,746 --> 00:02:14,613
Three Brittanies in the Jacuzzi.

60
00:02:14,681 --> 00:02:15,948
Three.

61
00:02:16,016 --> 00:02:17,249
Why didn't I join them?

62
00:02:17,317 --> 00:02:19,285
Why do you think you didn't join them?

63
00:02:19,352 --> 00:02:21,620
I don't know, Doctor. That's what I pay you

64
00:02:21,688 --> 00:02:23,122
to figure out, isn't it?

65
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,125
Have you ever considered that
all of this excessive partying

66
00:02:27,465 --> 00:02:30,134
may be your attempt to fill a void?

67
00:02:30,178 --> 00:02:31,144
"Attempt"?

68
00:02:31,212 --> 00:02:32,946
I filled five voids last night.

69
00:02:33,014 --> 00:02:35,816
That's not what I mean.

70
00:02:35,883 --> 00:02:38,919
A void in your emotional life.

71
00:02:38,986 --> 00:02:40,821
You sound...

72
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,824
lonely.

73
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:45,158
"Lonely"?

74
00:02:45,226 --> 00:02:47,861
Have... have you been listening
to a word I've said?

75
00:02:47,929 --> 00:02:49,296
I am never alone.

76
00:02:49,363 --> 00:02:51,665
I'm constantly surrounded by people.

77
00:02:51,732 --> 00:02:53,834
You know? I party whenever I desire.

78
00:02:53,901 --> 00:02:54,968
My bed never cold.

79
00:02:55,036 --> 00:02:56,837
Lucifer, being alone

80
00:02:56,904 --> 00:02:59,707
and being lonely are two
entirely different things.

81
00:02:59,748 --> 00:03:00,982
- Are they?
- Yes!

82
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,216
You may be surrounded by others,

83
00:03:02,284 --> 00:03:05,219
but do you truly consider
any of those people

84
00:03:05,287 --> 00:03:06,955
your friend?

85
00:03:08,128 --> 00:03:09,630
My friend?

86
00:03:09,661 --> 00:03:10,796
A peer you respect.

87
00:03:11,344 --> 00:03:12,744
Someone you like to spend time with.

88
00:03:12,812 --> 00:03:15,347
Someone with whom you share
a meaningful connection.

89
00:03:15,415 --> 00:03:18,083
Well, you and I connect quite well.

90
00:03:18,151 --> 00:03:19,818
I'm talking personal.

91
00:03:19,886 --> 00:03:21,987
What about Maze?

92
00:03:22,055 --> 00:03:23,388
No.

93
00:03:23,456 --> 00:03:25,090
She and I are on the outs, I'm afraid.

94
00:03:25,158 --> 00:03:27,325
Long story filled with betrayal.

95
00:03:27,393 --> 00:03:29,327
You actually make a cameo in it.

96
00:03:29,395 --> 00:03:32,364
How about Detective Decker?

97
00:03:32,432 --> 00:03:34,833
Do you consider her your friend?

98
00:03:36,235 --> 00:03:39,037
Well, quite honestly, I...

99
00:03:39,105 --> 00:03:41,640
I'm not sure what we are.

100
00:03:45,945 --> 00:03:48,080
Lucifer?

101
00:03:48,147 --> 00:03:49,548
Listen, can we tal...?

102
00:03:49,615 --> 00:03:51,416
I don't have time for traitors.

103
00:03:51,484 --> 00:03:52,784
I get you don't want to talk to me.

104
00:03:52,852 --> 00:03:55,821
But someone else is here
to see you for a favor.

105
00:03:55,888 --> 00:03:57,322
Not in the mood, Maze.

106
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,390
Trust me.

107
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:01,326
You don't want to miss this one.

108
00:04:11,337 --> 00:04:12,671
You wanted to speak with me?

109
00:04:16,342 --> 00:04:18,610
Lucifer Morningstar.

110
00:04:18,678 --> 00:04:20,412
Father Frank Lawrence.

111
00:04:22,882 --> 00:04:24,649
A priest walks into a bar.

112
00:04:24,717 --> 00:04:26,952
I've heard this one before.
Never seen it, though.

113
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:29,221
At least not here.

114
00:04:29,288 --> 00:04:31,089
Padre, how did you

115
00:04:31,157 --> 00:04:32,691
of all people find me?

116
00:04:32,758 --> 00:04:35,093
Don't let the collar fool you.

117
00:04:35,161 --> 00:04:36,761
I have friends from all walks of life.

118
00:04:36,829 --> 00:04:38,130
People who tell me

119
00:04:38,197 --> 00:04:40,966
you're the man to see
when you run out of options.

120
00:04:41,033 --> 00:04:43,235
Ooh, what kind of nasty trouble

121
00:04:43,302 --> 00:04:44,769
have you gotten yourself into then?

122
00:04:44,837 --> 00:04:46,638
Pinched too much from the collection basket?

123
00:04:46,706 --> 00:04:49,441
I'm here about a neighborhood youth center.

124
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:51,109
Sounds dreadful.

125
00:04:51,177 --> 00:04:52,611
It is... When you realize

126
00:04:52,678 --> 00:04:55,113
it's being used as a front
for an illegal drug operation.

127
00:04:55,181 --> 00:04:56,248
The center's director,

128
00:04:56,315 --> 00:04:59,317
Lenny Arietta, is recruiting kids
from my church to move his product.

129
00:04:59,385 --> 00:05:01,920
Ah, so this is about young boys,
of course it is.

130
00:05:01,988 --> 00:05:03,788
One in particular.

131
00:05:03,856 --> 00:05:06,658
A kid named Connor.

132
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:09,661
He's had it rough.

133
00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:11,062
Lost both his parents at six.

134
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,864
Bounced from home to home, some juvie.

135
00:05:12,932 --> 00:05:15,700
But deep down, a good kid.

136
00:05:15,768 --> 00:05:17,068
So, diddling this one, are you?

137
00:05:19,272 --> 00:05:20,839
How about I not dignify that with an answer,

138
00:05:20,907 --> 00:05:22,073
and instead ask my favor?

139
00:05:22,141 --> 00:05:23,175
I was wondering when you'd get to it.

140
00:05:23,242 --> 00:05:24,209
I want you to talk to Arietta

141
00:05:24,277 --> 00:05:26,211
before Connor gets involved.

142
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:28,947
And why not go to the police?

143
00:05:29,015 --> 00:05:30,549
Got something to hide, do you?

144
00:05:30,616 --> 00:05:31,650
They were useless.

145
00:05:31,717 --> 00:05:33,151
Couldn't find anything on Arietta.

146
00:05:33,219 --> 00:05:34,719
Why not ask your boss then, hey?

147
00:05:34,787 --> 00:05:36,555
The Almighty Himself.

148
00:05:36,622 --> 00:05:37,822
I already have.

149
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,090
Oh, no luck?

150
00:05:39,158 --> 00:05:40,759
On the contrary,

151
00:05:40,826 --> 00:05:42,827
I believe he led me to you.

152
00:05:42,895 --> 00:05:44,663
I highly doubt that.

153
00:05:45,932 --> 00:05:48,767
So that's it, is it?

154
00:05:48,834 --> 00:05:51,770
Stop a drug ring to help
some kid get out of trouble.

155
00:05:51,837 --> 00:05:53,405
What's in it for you?

156
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,441
What is it you really want?

157
00:05:56,509 --> 00:05:59,311
That dirty dark desire I can

158
00:05:59,378 --> 00:06:02,013
see you struggling to hold in.

159
00:06:02,081 --> 00:06:05,450
What I really want...

160
00:06:05,518 --> 00:06:07,085
Yeah?

161
00:06:07,153 --> 00:06:10,722
is to put my fist through Arietta's face.

162
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,957
Ha!

163
00:06:12,024 --> 00:06:13,525
And there it is.

164
00:06:13,593 --> 00:06:15,060
Wrath.

165
00:06:15,127 --> 00:06:17,195
Ooh, not so high and mighty now, are you?

166
00:06:17,263 --> 00:06:19,664
We all have demons inside.

167
00:06:19,732 --> 00:06:22,367
My demon tends the bar.

168
00:06:22,435 --> 00:06:24,369
So come on, what else are you hiding?

169
00:06:24,437 --> 00:06:27,539
Hypocrites like you always have something.

170
00:06:27,607 --> 00:06:29,174
- You don't know anything about me.
- Oh, I know plenty.

171
00:06:29,242 --> 00:06:32,911
You and I are natural sworn enemies.

172
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:35,247
So, you gonna help me or not?

173
00:06:35,314 --> 00:06:37,983
My answer to you, Father,

174
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:41,928
is a big fat no.

175
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:44,774
Handle it yourself.

176
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,324
You're lucky I don't have any active cases,

177
00:06:51,392 --> 00:06:53,226
or else I'd send this to Narcotics.

178
00:06:53,294 --> 00:06:54,427
"Narcotics"? No, no, no, no.

179
00:06:54,495 --> 00:06:55,762
I don't give a damn about the drug dealer.

180
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,530
We're here to investigate the priest.

181
00:06:57,598 --> 00:06:58,198
Priest?

182
00:06:58,218 --> 00:06:59,351
I thought we were here to
talk to the youth director.

183
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,554
We are. To get dirt on the priest.

184
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:03,056
He must be hiding something.

185
00:07:03,905 --> 00:07:05,572
And what better to way
to stick it to dear old Dad

186
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,274
than prove that those
who speak on His behalf

187
00:07:07,341 --> 00:07:09,910
aren't as virtuous as they pretend to be.

188
00:07:09,977 --> 00:07:11,378
You thought it'd be a good idea

189
00:07:11,445 --> 00:07:12,913
to rope me into your imaginary family feud?

190
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,114
Great.

191
00:07:14,182 --> 00:07:16,683
Look, am I mistaken or
do you catch bad guys?

192
00:07:16,751 --> 00:07:18,585
Now, this priest is up to something.

193
00:07:18,653 --> 00:07:20,787
Something nefarious... I can feel it.

194
00:07:20,855 --> 00:07:23,223
Last I checked, your feelings
don't count as probable cause.

195
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:25,276
Well, isn't the fact that he came to me

196
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:26,511
probable cause enough?

197
00:07:26,578 --> 00:07:27,512
Or I could just interrogate

198
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:29,180
this youth director by myself.

199
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:31,516
No, just let me do the talking.

200
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,518
Mr. Arietta?

201
00:07:33,585 --> 00:07:35,386
Hmm.

202
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:37,054
Well, if I were trapped in here
with these vile children,

203
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:38,456
I'd lock my door as well.

204
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,669
Detective.

205
00:07:59,144 --> 00:08:00,678
He's dead.

206
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,146
Wow.

207
00:08:02,214 --> 00:08:04,182
Told you the priest was up to something.

M.E. puts the time of Arietta's death
between 11:30 and 12:00 this morning.

210
00:08:23,825 --> 00:08:26,093
'Cause was multiple hits
with a baseball bat.

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,261
There are some abrasions on his face.

212
00:08:27,328 --> 00:08:29,863
So it looks like he struggled
before he died.

213
00:08:29,867 --> 00:08:31,000
And I found this.

214
00:08:31,068 --> 00:08:32,535
Ooh, what's that?

215
00:08:32,603 --> 00:08:34,270
It's a voice modulator.
Hey, can you not do that?

216
00:08:34,338 --> 00:08:35,839
Detective, I am your father.

217
00:08:35,906 --> 00:08:37,574
It's not a toy, Lucifer.

218
00:08:37,641 --> 00:08:38,708
It could be evidence.

219
00:08:38,776 --> 00:08:39,742
Well, I'm impressed.

220
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,846
Looks like the priest handled
it himself after all.

221
00:08:42,913 --> 00:08:44,547
- We don't know the priest did this.
- Well, maybe you don't.

222
00:08:44,615 --> 00:08:45,515
Detective Decker?

223
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:46,683
Hold on.

224
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,151
Oh, can you take that?

225
00:08:48,219 --> 00:08:49,385
Yeah. Thank you.

226
00:08:54,525 --> 00:08:56,292
Hey, you're the head counselor, right?

227
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,660
Uh, yeah.

228
00:08:57,728 --> 00:08:59,062
Um, Eric Doyle.

229
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,263
Any idea who might've done this?

230
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,231
No.

231
00:09:01,298 --> 00:09:03,066
I mean, everyone liked Lenny.

232
00:09:03,134 --> 00:09:05,101
He was a good boss.

233
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:06,836
So, he had no enemies whatsoever, no?

234
00:09:06,904 --> 00:09:10,373
Especially any who wear clerical collars?

235
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:12,408
- So you know about the priest.
- Oh, yes.

236
00:09:12,476 --> 00:09:14,310
Yeah, that guy's always coming around here

237
00:09:14,378 --> 00:09:15,745
and getting into arguments with Lenny.

238
00:09:15,813 --> 00:09:17,113
Hmm.

239
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,516
But he's a priest.

240
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:20,783
Right.

241
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:23,553
Mr. Doyle, where were you between
11:30 and 12:00 this morning?

242
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:26,489
Uh... here.

243
00:09:26,557 --> 00:09:29,392
In counseling sessions
with, uh, Nikki and Connor.

244
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,460
Connor?

245
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,730
Well, that's the altar boy
from the priest's photo.

246
00:09:33,797 --> 00:09:35,198
So, is it, is it true

247
00:09:35,266 --> 00:09:36,599
Mr. Arietta's dead?

248
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:38,868
Well, duh, dumb-ass.

249
00:09:38,936 --> 00:09:41,137
It is. Yeah.

250
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,438
Did you know him well?

251
00:09:42,506 --> 00:09:43,339
A little, I guess.

252
00:09:43,407 --> 00:09:44,807
He, he, I mean, he ran the place.

253
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:48,077
Do you know if Mr. Arietta was
involved in any drug activity?

254
00:09:48,145 --> 00:09:49,546
Drugs?

255
00:09:49,613 --> 00:09:50,780
I mean, I wish he was.

256
00:09:50,848 --> 00:09:52,182
That would've made him more interesting.

257
00:09:52,249 --> 00:09:53,950
Okay.

258
00:09:54,018 --> 00:09:55,251
Enough about the dead guy.

259
00:09:55,319 --> 00:09:57,720
Tell me everything you know
about Padre Pederast.

260
00:09:57,788 --> 00:09:58,922
Who?

261
00:09:58,989 --> 00:10:00,156
Father Frank.

262
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,357
Did you see him do this?

263
00:10:01,425 --> 00:10:03,159
Do you think he's capable?

264
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,595
Father Frank kill Mr. Arietta?

265
00:10:05,663 --> 00:10:06,663
Yes.

266
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,031
No. No way.

267
00:10:08,098 --> 00:10:09,399
What do you mean "no way"?

268
00:10:09,466 --> 00:10:11,067
The guy's a creeper and
totally obsessed with you.

269
00:10:11,135 --> 00:10:12,669
He's just overprotective.

270
00:10:13,871 --> 00:10:15,138
Ever since my parents died,

271
00:10:15,206 --> 00:10:17,941
he feels like he's got to watch
out for me or something.

272
00:10:18,008 --> 00:10:19,375
But he's a good guy.

273
00:10:19,443 --> 00:10:21,010
He's just a little...

274
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:23,046
just a little annoying.

275
00:10:23,113 --> 00:10:24,013
- See?
- Hmm?

276
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,014
Annoying.

277
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,182
Mm-hmm.

278
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,750
When was the last time you saw him?

279
00:10:27,818 --> 00:10:29,586
Uh, he... Here this morning.

280
00:10:29,653 --> 00:10:32,021
Yeah, preacher seemed pretty pissed.

281
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,089
Oh.

282
00:10:33,157 --> 00:10:34,357
Uh, wait, you don't really think

283
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,892
that, like, Father Frank did this, right?

284
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,427
- 100%.
- Thank you.

285
00:10:37,494 --> 00:10:39,862
You've been very helpful.

286
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:40,863
Right.

287
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,699
See? Told you.

288
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:45,902
No, I hate to admit it, but
you might be on to something.

289
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:46,869
Sorry, what was that?

290
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,204
You might be on to something.

291
00:10:52,309 --> 00:10:53,876
That's him.

292
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,678
Frank Lawrence.

293
00:10:55,746 --> 00:10:57,847
The most evil of people
have the most normal names,

294
00:10:57,915 --> 00:10:59,415
I've experienced.

295
00:10:59,483 --> 00:11:01,150
Beware anyone named Keith.

296
00:11:03,854 --> 00:11:06,256
Well, his criminal
record's pretty extensive.

297
00:11:06,323 --> 00:11:08,157
Assault and battery, disorderly conduct,

298
00:11:08,225 --> 00:11:09,892
- drug charges.
- See?

299
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,160
Not very priest-like.

300
00:11:11,228 --> 00:11:13,263
But nothing in the past ten years.

301
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:18,835
Ah, restraining order filed
by Lenny Arietta last week.

302
00:11:18,902 --> 00:11:21,004
Ah, well, it's funny how Padre Punchy

303
00:11:21,071 --> 00:11:22,272
failed to mention a restraining order.

304
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:23,706
Please tell me now we have enough

305
00:11:23,774 --> 00:11:25,008
to bring this priest down.

306
00:11:25,075 --> 00:11:26,276
We have enough to bring him in.

307
00:11:26,343 --> 00:11:27,677
You ready to go to church?

308
00:11:27,745 --> 00:11:29,946
Bringing down a priest is
the only reason I ever would.

309
00:11:30,014 --> 00:11:31,481
In. Bring him in.

310
00:11:31,548 --> 00:11:33,116
Yes, bring him in so we can bring him down.

311
00:11:35,085 --> 00:11:37,020
Hey, um, you go ahead.

312
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,788
I'll... I'll meet you downstairs.

313
00:11:38,856 --> 00:11:41,324
Just something I got to do first.

314
00:11:50,901 --> 00:11:53,036
Hey, so I'm in the middle of something,

315
00:11:53,103 --> 00:11:54,570
but I haven't seen you all week.

316
00:11:54,638 --> 00:11:56,205
Are we gonna talk about what happened?

317
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:00,810
What?

318
00:12:00,878 --> 00:12:02,278
Our kiss, Dan.

319
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,980
It's kind of a big deal.

320
00:12:04,048 --> 00:12:05,581
Right, I'm sorry, Chloe.

321
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:06,983
I've had a lot on my mind.

322
00:12:07,051 --> 00:12:08,951
Yeah. You okay?

323
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:09,952
Yeah, I'm fine.

324
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,988
But we should talk.

325
00:12:12,056 --> 00:12:13,456
About everything.

326
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,724
Just not here.

327
00:12:14,792 --> 00:12:17,093
Okay, do you want to do dinner
at my place, get takeout?

328
00:12:17,161 --> 00:12:19,329
Yeah. Zhang Chow's?

329
00:12:19,396 --> 00:12:21,831
Zhang Chow... I was just gonna say that.

330
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:22,932
Yeah, all right.

331
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,467
Sounds good.

332
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,469
- Talk to you later.
- Yeah.

333
00:12:35,446 --> 00:12:37,380
Oh, how's it going, buddy?

334
00:12:37,448 --> 00:12:41,017
Malcolm, what are you doing here?

335
00:12:45,122 --> 00:12:47,056
Oh, you didn't hear the good news?

336
00:12:47,124 --> 00:12:49,325
Back on duty.

337
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:50,793
So soon after, um...?

338
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:53,062
What, my partner's suicide?

339
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,700
Yeah, can't let that keep
me down, am I right?

340
00:12:57,768 --> 00:12:58,801
But don't worry.

341
00:12:58,869 --> 00:13:00,236
I already got a new partner.

342
00:13:00,304 --> 00:13:02,905
Yeah, convinced the higher-ups
to give me my first choice.

343
00:13:02,973 --> 00:13:04,374
You.

344
00:13:05,609 --> 00:13:07,377
Oh, my God.

345
00:13:07,444 --> 00:13:10,646
Seriously, Dan, you got to try this.

346
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,018
What's your game, Malcolm?

347
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,388
Partners? Are you kidding me?

348
00:13:18,455 --> 00:13:21,391
Oh, well, what better way to
keep an eye on you, am I right?

349
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:22,658
I saw you talking to Decker.

350
00:13:22,726 --> 00:13:24,093
You want to tell her, don't you?

351
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,664
What, that I'm the one who shot you?

352
00:13:28,732 --> 00:13:29,632
Why would I do that?

353
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,667
Your conscience.

354
00:13:31,735 --> 00:13:33,269
I know you, Danny Boy.

355
00:13:33,337 --> 00:13:35,438
You forget, this ain't the
first time we've been partners.

356
00:13:35,506 --> 00:13:37,173
I looked the other way a few times.

357
00:13:37,241 --> 00:13:38,975
- That didn't make us partners.
- Sure, it did.

358
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:40,810
Yeah, and it ate away at you

359
00:13:40,878 --> 00:13:42,578
until you finally had enough at Palmetto.

360
00:13:42,646 --> 00:13:43,980
I didn't have a choice.

361
00:13:44,047 --> 00:13:45,314
No, I-I understand. No, I get it, I get it.

362
00:13:45,382 --> 00:13:47,083
No, you were just protecting
that wife of yours.

363
00:13:47,151 --> 00:13:48,584
She saw me, I went for my gun.

364
00:13:48,652 --> 00:13:51,090
Boom. No, you took me out
before I could take her out.

365
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,955
No, no hard feelings.

366
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,490
I understand.

367
00:13:54,558 --> 00:13:59,195
But... the minute you want to come clean,

368
00:13:59,263 --> 00:14:02,899
you and I... we both go to jail.

369
00:14:02,966 --> 00:14:04,700
Hmm?

370
00:14:04,768 --> 00:14:08,171
I mean, you... you really want
to throw away your marriage?

371
00:14:08,238 --> 00:14:11,140
Watch little Trixie grow
up from behind bars?

372
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,408
Think this through, Dan.

373
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:16,145
With you gone, uh, who's
gonna protect Chloe?

374
00:14:16,213 --> 00:14:19,048
What do you want from me, Malcolm?

375
00:14:19,116 --> 00:14:20,583
Nothing much.

376
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:24,053
You're gonna go into evidence
and borrow something for me.

377
00:14:24,121 --> 00:14:26,088
Easy peasy lemon squeezy.

378
00:14:46,535 --> 00:14:49,070
Knock, knock.

379
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,574
Stay here while I look for Father Frank,

380
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,209
- and don't get into any trouble.
- It's a church!

381
00:14:54,276 --> 00:14:57,145
What am I gonna do, pray too hard?

382
00:15:02,752 --> 00:15:04,953
Hello.

383
00:15:05,021 --> 00:15:07,222
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

384
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:09,958
It's been three hours
since my last confession.

385
00:15:10,026 --> 00:15:11,226
Three hours?

386
00:15:11,293 --> 00:15:12,961
Speedy sinner, I like it.

387
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:15,764
No, I just need more guidance.

388
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:20,702
I'm still having lustful
thoughts about another man.

389
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,003
Splendid.

390
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:23,972
Who's the lucky fellow?

391
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,776
Um, my husband's limo driver.

392
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,844
What should I do, Father?

393
00:15:29,912 --> 00:15:33,815
Well, my dear, uh, you should
embrace your desires.

394
00:15:33,883 --> 00:15:35,617
Really?

395
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:38,853
Uh, when I was here earlier,
Father Frank told me

396
00:15:38,921 --> 00:15:40,655
I should be faithful to my husband.

397
00:15:40,723 --> 00:15:42,657
Well, I don't know why you're
listening to that fool.

398
00:15:42,725 --> 00:15:44,793
I mean, let's be honest,
if you wanted to be faithful,

399
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,996
then you wouldn't be fantasizing
about your limo driver,

400
00:15:48,064 --> 00:15:49,664
- now, would you, eh?
- You're right.

401
00:15:49,732 --> 00:15:51,132
No, no, no, no, no, don't feel bad.

402
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,901
You have those desires for a reason.

403
00:15:52,968 --> 00:15:54,436
You should act on them.

404
00:15:54,503 --> 00:15:56,838
I mean, you can always come
back here, confess,

405
00:15:56,906 --> 00:15:58,106
and all will be forgiven.

406
00:15:58,174 --> 00:15:59,974
Isn't that how this system of yours works?

407
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,610
When you put it that way...

408
00:16:02,678 --> 00:16:04,813
Lucifer, what do you think you're doing?

409
00:16:06,849 --> 00:16:10,185
For your penance, ten Bloody
Marys and a good shag.

410
00:16:20,262 --> 00:16:22,630
I know you're there.

411
00:16:24,033 --> 00:16:25,700
What, are you watching over me?

412
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:29,571
Like my own guardian angel.

413
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,174
Yeah.

414
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,577
Grumpy guardian angel.

415
00:16:35,644 --> 00:16:37,112
Forgotten about our deal, Malcolm?

416
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:40,849
Because I brought you back from
the dead for a single purpose.

417
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,753
Yeah, about that, I've...
been meaning to ask.

418
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,588
Why me?

419
00:16:46,655 --> 00:16:47,989
- Why you?
- Yeah.

420
00:16:48,057 --> 00:16:50,658
I mean, uh, I must be something special

421
00:16:50,726 --> 00:16:52,360
for you to go to all that trouble.

422
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:55,130
Come on, don't flatter yourself.

423
00:16:55,197 --> 00:16:58,366
You're simply in a unique
position to do what I need done.

424
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,369
'Cause I'm a cop.

425
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,872
That, yeah.

426
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,608
Yeah, and because I know you'll do anything

427
00:17:06,675 --> 00:17:08,743
to avoid going back to Hell.

428
00:17:10,913 --> 00:17:14,282
Now, stop bothering me with these questions

429
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,950
and just get to the task I've given you.

430
00:17:16,018 --> 00:17:18,453
Don't you worry your shiny little head.

431
00:17:18,521 --> 00:17:20,421
I'm already on it, all right?

432
00:17:20,489 --> 00:17:22,423
Everything's going according to plan.

433
00:17:22,491 --> 00:17:24,392
Don't keep me waiting.

434
00:17:26,362 --> 00:17:30,765
Patience is not one of my virtues.

435
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:35,904
I promise you, I... I got this.

436
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:43,332
Mr. Morningstar, surprised to see you again.

437
00:17:43,649 --> 00:17:45,850
Oh, I wouldn't miss this for the world.

438
00:17:45,918 --> 00:17:48,152
Father Frank, when was the
last time you saw Lenny Arietta?

439
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,587
This morning.

440
00:17:49,592 --> 00:17:50,892
Despite the restraining order.

441
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,394
I answer to a higher authority.

442
00:17:52,462 --> 00:17:54,029
Not today you don't.

443
00:17:54,621 --> 00:17:55,988
What happened when you saw him?

444
00:17:56,055 --> 00:17:57,556
We exchanged words.

445
00:17:57,624 --> 00:17:59,391
Things got a little heated.

446
00:17:59,459 --> 00:18:00,559
What were you fighting about?

447
00:18:00,627 --> 00:18:02,694
That altar boy of his, of course.

448
00:18:02,762 --> 00:18:04,696
Why were you fighting over Connor?

449
00:18:04,764 --> 00:18:06,899
Because I'm worried that
Arietta's gonna pull Connor

450
00:18:06,966 --> 00:18:08,133
into his drug ring.

451
00:18:08,201 --> 00:18:09,434
So, what, you give him a right hook?

452
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,437
Sadly, I did.

453
00:18:12,505 --> 00:18:14,373
- And then what?
- And then I left.

454
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,508
Ooh, no, no, no, I think
you skipped a part, didn't you?

455
00:18:16,576 --> 00:18:18,744
You know, the part where
you beat him to death

456
00:18:18,811 --> 00:18:19,745
with a baseball bat?

457
00:18:19,812 --> 00:18:22,281
He's dead?

458
00:18:22,348 --> 00:18:24,716
Oh, Heavenly Father.

459
00:18:24,784 --> 00:18:26,118
Oh, come on.

460
00:18:26,186 --> 00:18:27,619
How gullible do you think we are?

461
00:18:27,687 --> 00:18:31,990
I had troubles with the man,
but he didn't deserve to die.

462
00:18:32,058 --> 00:18:33,692
And I certainly didn't kill him.

463
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,160
Can you account for your whereabouts

464
00:18:35,228 --> 00:18:37,062
between 11:30 and 12:00 this morning?

465
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,331
Uh, I was here.

466
00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:40,866
Taking confessions.

467
00:18:40,934 --> 00:18:43,468
Mrs. Madison had a lot to say,
took up the whole hour.

468
00:18:43,536 --> 00:18:46,738
By chance, does Mrs. Madison
have a limo driver?

469
00:18:46,806 --> 00:18:48,941
She does.

470
00:18:49,008 --> 00:18:50,275
Damn.

471
00:18:50,343 --> 00:18:52,477
Just spoke to his alibi.

472
00:18:52,545 --> 00:18:53,745
What?

473
00:18:53,813 --> 00:18:54,746
The MILF in confession.

474
00:18:54,814 --> 00:18:56,048
Oh, great.

475
00:18:56,115 --> 00:18:57,816
Yeah, as much as I'm sure
that followed protocol,

476
00:18:57,884 --> 00:19:00,686
I'm still gonna have to question her myself.

477
00:19:02,322 --> 00:19:03,522
Father, I'm gonna need you

478
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,958
to come into the station for a statement.

479
00:19:08,361 --> 00:19:09,828
Well, maybe the padre has a twin brother

480
00:19:09,896 --> 00:19:11,897
who also takes confession; that
way he could still be guilty.

481
00:19:11,965 --> 00:19:14,866
Lucifer, seriously, will you just...

482
00:19:15,802 --> 00:19:16,969
Get down!

483
00:19:32,819 --> 00:19:35,654
And you wonder why I don't go to church.

484
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,326
I caught a partial from the shooter's plate.

485
00:19:44,394 --> 00:19:45,861
Can you run this for me?

486
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:47,196
- You got it.
- Thank you.

487
00:19:47,263 --> 00:19:49,631
So I spoke to Father Frank's alibi.

488
00:19:49,699 --> 00:19:51,000
Checks out.

489
00:19:51,067 --> 00:19:52,468
He was in confession with Mrs. Madison

490
00:19:52,535 --> 00:19:53,635
from 11:00 to 12:00.

491
00:19:53,703 --> 00:19:54,903
He's not our guy.

492
00:19:54,971 --> 00:19:56,171
Well, maybe she's lying.

493
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:58,374
I mean, you know the sort
of people that go to church.

494
00:19:58,441 --> 00:19:59,708
Sinners.

495
00:19:59,776 --> 00:20:03,212
Lab results from the voice
modulator came back empty.

496
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:05,714
No prints, no DNA.

497
00:20:05,782 --> 00:20:07,249
What, so you think this shooting

498
00:20:07,317 --> 00:20:09,718
and the youth director's
death are connected?

499
00:20:09,786 --> 00:20:12,154
We know they have at least
one thing in common.

500
00:20:13,493 --> 00:20:15,927
Father, you will be relieved
to know that no one was injured.

501
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:17,896
- Oh, thank God.
- Please don't.

502
00:20:17,964 --> 00:20:19,931
You care to tell us what that was about?

503
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:21,366
The shooting?

504
00:20:21,434 --> 00:20:22,834
I don't know.

505
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,604
This wasn't a random attack.

506
00:20:25,671 --> 00:20:27,839
They were shooting at you.

507
00:20:27,907 --> 00:20:29,107
But you don't seem surprised.

508
00:20:29,175 --> 00:20:30,809
What aren't you telling us?

509
00:20:36,249 --> 00:20:38,946
Keep your nose out of our business or else.

510
00:20:39,495 --> 00:20:41,030
The voice modulator from Arietta's office.

511
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,821
You should have gone
to the police with this.

512
00:20:42,889 --> 00:20:46,458
I assumed it was Arietta,
and I'm not afraid of him.

513
00:20:46,526 --> 00:20:48,593
But if it's The Spider...

514
00:20:48,661 --> 00:20:50,228
Spider?

515
00:20:50,296 --> 00:20:51,596
I've heard whispers of another dealer

516
00:20:51,664 --> 00:20:52,998
trying to take over Arietta's business.

517
00:20:53,065 --> 00:20:55,033
People call him "The Spider."

518
00:20:55,101 --> 00:20:56,735
Scary, violent reputation.

519
00:20:56,802 --> 00:20:58,370
Do you know who this Spider is?

520
00:20:58,437 --> 00:21:00,672
I don't.

521
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,074
You're holding something back, Father.
I can tell.

522
00:21:04,777 --> 00:21:06,478
Hmm?

523
00:21:06,546 --> 00:21:07,746
I have a confession to make.

524
00:21:07,813 --> 00:21:09,873
Finally! Well, the truth

525
00:21:09,986 --> 00:21:11,986
will set you free... isn't that
what your beloved book says?

526
00:21:12,002 --> 00:21:14,603
I lied when I said Connor was
in danger of becoming involved.

527
00:21:14,657 --> 00:21:16,625
He already is. Dealing for Arietta.

528
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:17,759
What, that's it?

529
00:21:17,827 --> 00:21:18,861
Oh, please don't tell me

530
00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:20,176
that's what you've been
holding back all this time.

531
00:21:20,663 --> 00:21:22,464
Wait. If Connor's already in deep,

532
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,732
why go to all this trouble to protect him?

533
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:26,034
He's had it rough.

534
00:21:26,102 --> 00:21:27,736
Thinks he can only rely on himself.

535
00:21:27,803 --> 00:21:30,005
He's a good kid, Detective.

536
00:21:30,072 --> 00:21:31,907
There's still hope for him.

537
00:21:31,974 --> 00:21:34,743
Father, you were today's target.

538
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,311
We need to worry about your safety first.

539
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:38,747
Do you have a place to stay?

540
00:21:38,814 --> 00:21:39,748
We can offer police protection.

541
00:21:39,815 --> 00:21:41,549
I'm fine right here.

542
00:21:43,286 --> 00:21:45,153
This... is my sanctuary.

543
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,255
Well, your sanctuary just got shot

544
00:21:47,323 --> 00:21:48,690
to high heaven, Padre.

545
00:21:48,758 --> 00:21:51,393
But if you're looking to lay low,

546
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,662
I believe I know just the place.

547
00:22:11,948 --> 00:22:13,448
Thought this might make you
feel more at home, you know.

548
00:22:13,516 --> 00:22:14,716
Sure you did.

549
00:22:16,152 --> 00:22:16,918
Hey.

550
00:22:18,521 --> 00:22:19,854
So, partial plates from the shooter's SUV

551
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,022
came back with a couple matches.

552
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,724
But this is interesting, one of them

553
00:22:22,792 --> 00:22:24,859
was recently reported stolen
outside the youth center.

554
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,861
Oh, you think someone inside's responsible.

555
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:28,596
I think it's too much of
a coincidence not to be,

556
00:22:28,664 --> 00:22:30,799
but I ordered traffic cam footage,

557
00:22:30,866 --> 00:22:32,467
so hopefully it'll show us who was driving.

558
00:22:32,535 --> 00:22:34,035
Hopefully.

559
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:36,604
Couldn't resist, huh?

560
00:22:36,672 --> 00:22:39,207
Well, the man deserves some fun.

561
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:41,509
Or you still want to prove he's a hypocrite.

562
00:22:41,577 --> 00:22:42,844
Well, what can I say?

563
00:22:42,912 --> 00:22:44,813
Temptation's in my nature.

564
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,914
Hmm.

565
00:22:45,982 --> 00:22:47,382
And how's that working out for you?

566
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,387
Padre, does this not bother you?

567
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:53,722
What can I say?

568
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,256
I love this song.

569
00:23:04,934 --> 00:23:06,334
You sure you're gonna
be okay in here, Father?

570
00:23:06,402 --> 00:23:08,036
This? Oh, absolutely.

571
00:23:08,104 --> 00:23:09,504
I grew up in places like this.

572
00:23:09,572 --> 00:23:11,773
Oh, I find that hard to believe.

573
00:23:11,841 --> 00:23:13,241
No one's born a priest.

574
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:14,843
Before the cloth, I was just

575
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:17,012
Frank Lawrence, touring musician.

576
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:18,380
Really?

577
00:23:18,447 --> 00:23:20,215
Let me guess... cowbell.

578
00:23:20,282 --> 00:23:21,783
Close. Piano.

579
00:23:21,851 --> 00:23:23,485
Good old rock and roll.

580
00:23:23,552 --> 00:23:25,620
Opened for Dylan, Bowie, the Stones...

581
00:23:25,688 --> 00:23:27,722
- The Rolling Stones?
- Yep.

582
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,624
It was a crazy time, let me tell you.

583
00:23:29,692 --> 00:23:30,925
I was a lot like you, really.

584
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:33,361
That's literally impossible.

585
00:23:33,429 --> 00:23:34,996
Thought the fun would never stop.

586
00:23:36,132 --> 00:23:38,166
Then, uh...

587
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:42,370
Father, you don't have to...

588
00:23:42,438 --> 00:23:44,172
No, no, no, no. Go on.

589
00:23:48,044 --> 00:23:48,977
Car accident.

590
00:23:49,045 --> 00:23:50,145
Ten years ago.

591
00:23:50,212 --> 00:23:52,414
I was traveling with Connor and his family.

592
00:23:52,481 --> 00:23:55,417
Uh, Connor's dad was a drummer,

593
00:23:55,484 --> 00:23:57,185
we used to play together.

594
00:23:57,253 --> 00:24:00,088
Another car swerved into our lane and, uh...

595
00:24:00,156 --> 00:24:03,124
Connor lost both his parents that night.

596
00:24:07,296 --> 00:24:08,696
My daughter was with us, too.

597
00:24:10,633 --> 00:24:13,468
She didn't make it, either.

598
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,040
Thought I'd seen some dark days.

599
00:24:19,108 --> 00:24:22,310
Nothing compared to losing my little girl.

600
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:23,578
My heart just...

601
00:24:23,646 --> 00:24:26,281
cracked right open.

602
00:24:26,348 --> 00:24:27,315
Well, you must have been

603
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:29,784
awfully angry at your beloved God.

604
00:24:31,253 --> 00:24:32,821
I was so... untethered.

605
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,222
Lost.

606
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:35,890
Turning to Him is what saved me.

607
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:38,993
So... hold on. God stole your spawn

608
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:41,563
and then you decided to worship Him?

609
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,964
I can't really explain it,

610
00:24:43,032 --> 00:24:44,899
but somehow it made me feel
that she was safe.

611
00:24:46,602 --> 00:24:48,703
That's when I discovered my faith.

612
00:24:49,872 --> 00:24:51,973
The church gave me purpose.

613
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:54,676
It was there that I crossed
paths with Connor again.

614
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,679
Me, a parent without a child;

615
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,647
him, a child without a parent.

616
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:04,152
We might not always understand it,

617
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,588
but God has a plan.

618
00:25:06,655 --> 00:25:08,556
Yes. I know.

619
00:25:08,624 --> 00:25:10,859
But why does everybody always
think it's a good plan?

620
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,997
Please excuse me, Father.

621
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:19,834
So can we just go back to this absurd notion

622
00:25:19,902 --> 00:25:21,503
that you and I are in any way similar?

623
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:23,872
- You're right. We're not.
- Thank you.

624
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,641
I'm probably a much better
piano player than you are.

625
00:25:49,498 --> 00:25:50,565
D-Do you know anything that doesn't

626
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,133
make me want to, you know, impale myself?

627
00:25:52,201 --> 00:25:53,668
Like, uh...

628
00:25:53,736 --> 00:25:55,136
Something more upbeat.

629
00:25:55,204 --> 00:25:56,137
Something a bit, um...

630
00:25:57,239 --> 00:25:58,406
I mean, like, uh...

631
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,710
Oh.

632
00:26:02,778 --> 00:26:04,145
I think I know what you mean.

633
00:26:05,247 --> 00:26:07,148
Something like that?

634
00:26:07,216 --> 00:26:08,616
- Yeah.
- Okay.

635
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,560
Father has got soul.

636
00:26:18,627 --> 00:26:20,295
You ain't seen nothing yet.

637
00:26:20,362 --> 00:26:21,462
- Oh.
- Yeah.

638
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:22,864
- You like to take the top?
- Why not?

639
00:26:22,932 --> 00:26:23,865
Excuse me.

640
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:29,137
Yah!

641
00:26:35,044 --> 00:26:36,911
Hoo!

642
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,148
Oh.

643
00:26:40,216 --> 00:26:41,516
Hi.

644
00:26:41,584 --> 00:26:42,917
Hi.

645
00:26:42,985 --> 00:26:45,019
Yeah, well, I suppose that wasn't

646
00:26:45,087 --> 00:26:46,087
completely terrible.

647
00:26:46,155 --> 00:26:47,388
Not completely.

648
00:26:48,457 --> 00:26:50,458
Um, sorry to interrupt,

649
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,293
but Father Frank's story
about The Spider checks out,

650
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:54,262
- and I got a lead.
- O...

651
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:55,263
So...

652
00:26:55,331 --> 00:26:56,564
kay.

653
00:26:56,632 --> 00:26:57,565
Right, well...

654
00:26:57,633 --> 00:26:58,700
Well, you stay here.

655
00:26:58,767 --> 00:27:00,468
You need the practice.

656
00:27:06,442 --> 00:27:08,610
I talked to Narcotics,
and one of their CI's said

657
00:27:08,677 --> 00:27:10,411
The Spider's rumored to hang out here.

658
00:27:10,479 --> 00:27:12,080
Well, I don't know why
you had to bring me along.

659
00:27:12,147 --> 00:27:14,048
What, are you anxious to get
back to your new friend?

660
00:27:14,116 --> 00:27:16,117
Please.

661
00:27:16,185 --> 00:27:17,318
The Devil friends with a priest?

662
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:18,286
That's absurd.

663
00:27:18,354 --> 00:27:21,522
It's absurdly adorable.

664
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,224
You know, it's okay
to admit you like the guy.

665
00:27:23,292 --> 00:27:26,160
He's everything that
I stand against, Detective.

666
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:27,762
Yeah, well, sometimes we get along best

667
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,397
with the people we're most different from.

668
00:27:29,465 --> 00:27:30,498
What?

669
00:27:32,968 --> 00:27:33,901
Hey.

670
00:27:33,969 --> 00:27:35,470
- Look.
- Oh.

671
00:27:35,537 --> 00:27:36,804
Little Miss Sunshine from the youth center.

672
00:27:36,872 --> 00:27:38,473
Yeah, Nikki.

673
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,607
What's that she's doing?

674
00:27:39,675 --> 00:27:41,542
Drug deal.

675
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:44,012
And a smooth one.

676
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,780
Maybe she's The Spider.

677
00:27:45,848 --> 00:27:47,649
Ooh, black widow, then. Lovely.

678
00:27:47,716 --> 00:27:48,650
Wait.

679
00:27:48,717 --> 00:27:51,185
She's giving it to someone else.

680
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:54,689
To Connor.

681
00:27:57,993 --> 00:27:59,794
Get down!

682
00:27:59,862 --> 00:28:01,529
Come on!

683
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:03,998
Important police work,

684
00:28:04,066 --> 00:28:05,333
get on!

685
00:28:13,175 --> 00:28:14,142
Gone.

686
00:28:14,209 --> 00:28:15,443
Great.

687
00:28:15,511 --> 00:28:17,345
And why was the black widow
giving her cash to altar boy?

688
00:28:17,413 --> 00:28:18,913
You never want to carry

689
00:28:18,981 --> 00:28:20,415
drugs and money on you at the same time.

690
00:28:20,482 --> 00:28:21,416
Makes you a target.

691
00:28:23,052 --> 00:28:26,287
Or because Connor's The Spider.

692
00:28:26,355 --> 00:28:28,289
Traffic cam footage.

693
00:28:30,025 --> 00:28:31,893
Ah, from the church shooting.

694
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,928
So the boy the priest was trying to protect

695
00:28:33,996 --> 00:28:35,229
is the one who tried to kill him?

696
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:38,032
Well, isn't that an
ironic kick in the cassock.

697
00:28:49,677 --> 00:28:52,712
This doesn't prove Connor's The Spider.

698
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,847
It's pretty damning, Father.

699
00:28:54,915 --> 00:28:56,315
And it's enough for the APB

700
00:28:56,383 --> 00:28:57,984
- that just went out.
- Ah.

701
00:28:58,052 --> 00:28:59,318
Connor's been declared armed and dangerous.

702
00:28:59,386 --> 00:29:00,319
Armed and dangerous?

703
00:29:00,387 --> 00:29:01,721
The boy needs to be helped,

704
00:29:01,789 --> 00:29:03,056
convinced to turn himself in.

705
00:29:03,123 --> 00:29:04,023
Father, he shot at you.

706
00:29:04,091 --> 00:29:06,693
He fired into a room full of kids.

707
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,695
Yes, but he shot up, didn't he?

708
00:29:08,762 --> 00:29:10,897
We'll do everything we can
to bring him in peacefully.

709
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,801
If you'll excuse me, I...

710
00:29:14,868 --> 00:29:15,935
need some air.

711
00:29:16,003 --> 00:29:17,737
Uh...

712
00:29:17,805 --> 00:29:19,105
I have some digging to do.

713
00:29:19,173 --> 00:29:20,840
Will you watch over him until I get back?

714
00:29:20,861 --> 00:29:22,862
What? You want me to babysit the priest?

715
00:29:23,177 --> 00:29:25,578
I babysit you all the time.

716
00:29:38,592 --> 00:29:40,526
Need a light?

717
00:29:42,563 --> 00:29:44,363
No, thanks.

718
00:29:44,431 --> 00:29:45,498
Quit years ago.

719
00:29:45,566 --> 00:29:47,533
Still enjoy the ritual, though.

720
00:29:47,601 --> 00:29:49,001
Always keep one on me.

721
00:29:49,069 --> 00:29:52,672
Please tell me you didn't
come out here to talk to Him.

722
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,640
God?

723
00:29:54,708 --> 00:29:56,142
This is as good a spot as any.

724
00:29:59,012 --> 00:29:59,946
Right.

725
00:30:01,482 --> 00:30:02,381
Does He, uh...

726
00:30:02,449 --> 00:30:03,649
does He ever talk back?

727
00:30:03,717 --> 00:30:06,419
I don't need to hear Him to... hear Him.

728
00:30:06,487 --> 00:30:07,687
If you know what I mean.

729
00:30:07,755 --> 00:30:10,223
Well, yes, He never talks to me, either.

730
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:11,991
Listen, um...

731
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:14,093
sorry about the altar boy.

732
00:30:14,161 --> 00:30:15,795
Surely you know you're not to blame.

733
00:30:15,863 --> 00:30:18,464
I mean, some people are
just... beyond saving.

734
00:30:18,532 --> 00:30:19,732
That's where you're wrong.

735
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,200
There's still hope for him.

736
00:30:23,637 --> 00:30:25,138
He shot up your church,

737
00:30:25,205 --> 00:30:27,373
he's most likely running
a drug ring behind your back,

738
00:30:27,441 --> 00:30:29,175
and, oh, yes, killed a man.

739
00:30:29,243 --> 00:30:30,243
I don't believe that.

740
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,410
Look, what if it's true?

741
00:30:31,478 --> 00:30:32,545
Then he needs me even more.

742
00:30:32,613 --> 00:30:34,547
How can you still have faith in this boy?

743
00:30:34,615 --> 00:30:36,949
God has faith in him.

744
00:30:37,017 --> 00:30:38,117
In all of us.

745
00:30:38,185 --> 00:30:39,385
Even in our darkest moments.

746
00:30:39,453 --> 00:30:40,686
Oh, you really believe that.

747
00:30:40,754 --> 00:30:42,088
I do.

748
00:30:42,156 --> 00:30:43,623
Why don't you?

749
00:30:45,926 --> 00:30:49,061
Because He didn't have faith in me.

750
00:30:50,564 --> 00:30:52,632
I felt that way once, too.

751
00:30:52,699 --> 00:30:55,368
But now I know, deep in my heart,

752
00:30:55,435 --> 00:30:57,470
God has a plan for me.

753
00:30:57,538 --> 00:30:59,372
Oh, His plan for me was quite clear.

754
00:30:59,439 --> 00:31:02,041
How do you know it's finished?

755
00:31:11,718 --> 00:31:13,653
Mm.

756
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:18,424
What?

757
00:31:18,492 --> 00:31:20,827
One of my parishioners, uh,

758
00:31:20,894 --> 00:31:22,862
a lot of them are still
upset about the shooting.

759
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:24,130
Excuse me.

760
00:31:25,199 --> 00:31:27,099
Yeah.

761
00:31:35,943 --> 00:31:37,009
There.

762
00:31:37,077 --> 00:31:39,478
I got what you wanted from evidence.

763
00:31:44,251 --> 00:31:45,585
Are we done?

764
00:31:45,652 --> 00:31:48,988
Not by a long shot.

765
00:31:49,056 --> 00:31:50,656
Partner.

766
00:31:57,798 --> 00:31:58,731
Hey.

767
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,967
Did you leave Father Frank upstairs?

768
00:32:01,034 --> 00:32:02,134
No, he took a call.

769
00:32:02,202 --> 00:32:04,136
I presumed he came down here.

770
00:32:04,204 --> 00:32:05,705
Why would he do that?

771
00:32:12,346 --> 00:32:14,580
Maze, the priest, have you seen him?

772
00:32:14,648 --> 00:32:16,148
So you're talking to me now?

773
00:32:16,216 --> 00:32:18,885
Have you seen him?!

774
00:32:18,952 --> 00:32:21,520
He was down here on his phone.

775
00:32:21,588 --> 00:32:22,955
Heard him talking to someone named Connor.

776
00:32:23,023 --> 00:32:24,357
- He left to go meet him.
- He left?

777
00:32:24,424 --> 00:32:25,558
Where to?

778
00:32:28,428 --> 00:32:30,963
Maybe he's trying to convince
Connor to turn himself in.

779
00:32:31,031 --> 00:32:33,399
No. He's probably trying
to hide the little miscreant.

780
00:32:33,467 --> 00:32:35,368
Put his faith in God, not the police.

781
00:32:35,435 --> 00:32:37,803
Why do you care about a priest?

782
00:32:37,871 --> 00:32:39,338
I don't.

783
00:32:39,406 --> 00:32:40,539
Where would he hide him?

784
00:32:40,607 --> 00:32:43,809
Somewhere he considers safe, I assume.

785
00:32:43,877 --> 00:32:45,544
Sanctuary.

786
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:01,327
You don't want to do this.

787
00:33:01,395 --> 00:33:03,229
- I know you. This isn't you.
- Sorry,

788
00:33:03,297 --> 00:33:04,615
I don't have a choice, okay?

789
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:06,849
- I have to do this.
- I get it.

790
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:07,673
You don't think you can rely on anyone else

791
00:33:07,701 --> 00:33:09,800
to survive... but you're not alone.

792
00:33:10,004 --> 00:33:11,455
I'm here for you, whenever you need me.

793
00:33:11,471 --> 00:33:13,806
I don't need you! Okay?

794
00:33:13,874 --> 00:33:15,908
I don't need anybody!

795
00:33:15,976 --> 00:33:17,777
Go on, then, shoot the altar boy.

796
00:33:17,844 --> 00:33:19,845
- Shh.
- In the leg or something, obviously.

797
00:33:19,913 --> 00:33:21,647
Just do it, Connor.

798
00:33:21,715 --> 00:33:23,549
Pull the damn trigger already.

799
00:33:23,617 --> 00:33:24,917
That's Eric Doyle.

800
00:33:24,985 --> 00:33:25,885
The counselor.

801
00:33:25,953 --> 00:33:27,954
That's our Spider.

802
00:33:29,957 --> 00:33:34,160
You know, Nikki... I trust.

803
00:33:34,227 --> 00:33:35,261
But you?

804
00:33:35,329 --> 00:33:37,096
I think you're too
attached to this preacher.

805
00:33:37,164 --> 00:33:39,031
You're gonna have to show me

806
00:33:39,099 --> 00:33:40,333
that you're not.

807
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,467
No shot from here.

808
00:33:41,535 --> 00:33:42,868
I know you, Connor.

809
00:33:42,936 --> 00:33:43,936
That drive-by,

810
00:33:44,004 --> 00:33:45,571
you intentionally missed me, didn't you?

811
00:33:45,639 --> 00:33:46,772
Stop talking. Please.

812
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,174
Make him stop talking.

813
00:33:48,241 --> 00:33:49,775
- It's really easy.
- You couldn't do it then,

814
00:33:49,843 --> 00:33:51,510
and you don't want to do it now.

815
00:33:51,578 --> 00:33:52,578
God's giving you

816
00:33:52,646 --> 00:33:54,647
a second chance right here.

817
00:33:54,715 --> 00:33:56,148
E-Enough with the sermon, preacher!

818
00:33:56,216 --> 00:33:58,584
Connor, just shoot
this son of a bitch already.

819
00:33:58,652 --> 00:34:00,519
Just follow your heart, son.

820
00:34:00,587 --> 00:34:02,121
I have faith in you.

821
00:34:10,197 --> 00:34:12,498
I can't do it, Doyle. I'm sorry.

822
00:34:12,566 --> 00:34:13,699
I'm sorry, too, kid.

823
00:34:13,767 --> 00:34:15,701
I can't allow weakness,

824
00:34:15,769 --> 00:34:17,970
not when I've just taken control.

825
00:34:18,038 --> 00:34:18,804
No!

826
00:34:22,009 --> 00:34:23,642
Father!

827
00:34:27,281 --> 00:34:29,549
Hands up. Get down on the ground.

828
00:34:29,603 --> 00:34:31,985
No, no, no, you idiot!

829
00:34:38,324 --> 00:34:39,892
The bloody hell were you thinking?

830
00:34:40,004 --> 00:34:41,790
This is Unit 831 at St. Morgan's Church.

831
00:34:41,791 --> 00:34:43,083
We need two ambos, code 4.

832
00:34:43,178 --> 00:34:44,769
Don't go anywhere, you moron!

833
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:48,651
It's okay. I'm not afraid of dying.

834
00:34:48,706 --> 00:34:50,741
Well, you should be. It's really
boring where you're headed.

835
00:34:50,808 --> 00:34:53,577
I hope so. I've had enough
excitement for one life.

836
00:34:53,644 --> 00:34:55,112
Stop talking like that.

837
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:57,981
You've got more to do here.
You've got more people to annoy.

838
00:34:58,049 --> 00:34:59,049
Pressure on the wound.

839
00:34:59,117 --> 00:35:00,217
I am!

840
00:35:00,284 --> 00:35:02,719
Just come on, Frank,
stay with me, stay with me.

841
00:35:04,255 --> 00:35:06,790
Oh, uh... at first...

842
00:35:06,858 --> 00:35:10,494
I didn't understand why
God put you in my path.

843
00:35:10,561 --> 00:35:13,296
But then it hit me.

844
00:35:13,364 --> 00:35:16,466
Maybe... He put me in yours.

845
00:35:16,534 --> 00:35:18,235
I... highly doubt it.

846
00:35:18,302 --> 00:35:20,103
He gave up on me a long time ago.

847
00:35:20,171 --> 00:35:23,373
You're wrong, Lucifer.

848
00:35:24,475 --> 00:35:25,876
Remember...

849
00:35:25,943 --> 00:35:27,511
your father...

850
00:35:27,578 --> 00:35:29,946
has-has a plan.

851
00:35:30,014 --> 00:35:31,615
My father?

852
00:35:31,682 --> 00:35:33,083
Yeah.

853
00:35:33,151 --> 00:35:35,052
You know?

854
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,354
Frank?

855
00:35:38,556 --> 00:35:40,490
Frank!

856
00:35:42,093 --> 00:35:43,960
Frank.

857
00:35:51,903 --> 00:35:53,370
Time to pull the legs

858
00:35:53,438 --> 00:35:54,738
off The Spider.

859
00:35:56,908 --> 00:35:58,008
Lucifer...

860
00:35:58,709 --> 00:35:59,643
Lucifer, stop!

861
00:36:01,579 --> 00:36:02,979
Why did you do this?

862
00:36:03,047 --> 00:36:04,181
- I don't know, man.
- Why?!

863
00:36:04,248 --> 00:36:05,582
He was bringing too much heat!

864
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:07,584
Why?! Why...?!

865
00:36:08,358 --> 00:36:11,060
Lucifer, stop. Father Frank

866
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:13,395
wouldn't want this.

867
00:36:17,334 --> 00:36:18,367
Stop.

868
00:36:47,097 --> 00:36:49,131
Connor gave us everything.

869
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:50,199
The drug front.

870
00:36:50,267 --> 00:36:52,134
How Doyle took on "The Spider" name

871
00:36:52,202 --> 00:36:54,103
and killed Arietta to
take over the business.

872
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:55,204
With Connor's cooperation,

873
00:36:55,272 --> 00:36:57,439
he won't do much juvie, if any at all.

874
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:59,775
Maybe Father Frank was right.

875
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:02,178
Maybe there's hope for him yet.

876
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:06,182
You okay?

877
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:10,186
I'm fine.

878
00:37:10,253 --> 00:37:11,987
Good night, Detective.

879
00:37:38,281 --> 00:37:39,215
You...

880
00:37:39,282 --> 00:37:42,451
you cruel, manipulative bastard!

881
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:45,221
Was this all part of Your plan?

882
00:37:45,288 --> 00:37:49,024
It's all just a game to You, isn't it?

883
00:37:49,092 --> 00:37:51,193
Eh?

884
00:37:51,261 --> 00:37:53,996
Well, I know punishment,

885
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:56,665
and he did not deserve that.

886
00:37:57,534 --> 00:38:00,102
He followed Your stupid rules

887
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:02,271
and it still wasn't good enough!

888
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:04,840
So what does it take to please You?

889
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:06,442
Break Your rules and you fall!

890
00:38:06,509 --> 00:38:08,410
Follow them and you still lose?!

891
00:38:08,478 --> 00:38:10,880
Doesn't matter whether you're a sinner!

892
00:38:10,947 --> 00:38:13,649
Doesn't matter whether you're a saint!

893
00:38:13,717 --> 00:38:16,785
Nobody can win, so what's the point?

894
00:38:16,853 --> 00:38:19,655
What's the bloody point?

895
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:30,866
Dan, I know I wanted to talk, but, um...

896
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:32,468
my mind, it's just...

897
00:38:32,535 --> 00:38:33,736
Somewhere else?

898
00:38:34,638 --> 00:38:36,171
Yeah.

899
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:38,173
Yeah, mine, too.

900
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:43,178
Can we do this another time?

901
00:38:43,246 --> 00:38:44,980
Yeah.

902
00:38:45,048 --> 00:38:47,049
No problem.

903
00:39:15,545 --> 00:39:16,679
Hi.

904
00:39:21,851 --> 00:39:23,919
Bit late for a new case, isn't it?

905
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:26,488
I'm not here for a case.

906
00:39:26,556 --> 00:39:28,624
I'm here for you.

907
00:39:28,692 --> 00:39:30,059
Oh.

908
00:39:30,126 --> 00:39:32,361
Really?

909
00:39:32,429 --> 00:39:33,796
Yeah.

910
00:39:33,863 --> 00:39:36,332
Thought you could use a friend.

911
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:48,344
Do you play?

912
00:39:48,411 --> 00:39:49,411
Mm.

913
00:39:49,479 --> 00:39:51,680
- No. No, I don't.
- Come on,

914
00:39:51,748 --> 00:39:53,148
- you must know something.
- No.

915
00:39:53,216 --> 00:39:54,917
Uh...

916
00:39:54,985 --> 00:39:57,820
All right, well...

917
00:39:57,887 --> 00:39:59,455
let me see.

918
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:02,758
- I had three years of lessons...
- Mm.

919
00:40:02,826 --> 00:40:05,894
and this is all I remember.

920
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:11,500
Surely, you must be joking.

921
00:40:16,973 --> 00:40:18,273
All right.

922
00:40:41,798 --> 00:40:42,965
Mm.

923
00:40:43,033 --> 00:40:45,134
Ah...

924
00:40:46,002 --> 00:40:47,603
Mmm.

925
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,741
Enjoying the life I gave you?

926
00:40:54,044 --> 00:40:55,844
Hey...

927
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:57,780
did food taste this good before I died?

928
00:40:57,847 --> 00:40:59,915
'Cause I don't remember it
being this friggin' delicious.

929
00:40:59,983 --> 00:41:03,318
I don't care what you're doing
with your new life, Malcolm...

930
00:41:03,386 --> 00:41:05,721
except for what I've asked of you.

931
00:41:05,789 --> 00:41:07,623
What's taking so long?

932
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:09,825
Come on, come on, chill out, Amenadude.

933
00:41:09,893 --> 00:41:12,027
Here, have some waffles.

934
00:41:14,364 --> 00:41:16,532
Do you want to go back?

935
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:19,168
Do you... want...

936
00:41:19,235 --> 00:41:20,402
to go back?

937
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:22,938
Because I can make that happen.

938
00:41:23,006 --> 00:41:24,440
Yeah.

939
00:41:24,507 --> 00:41:26,775
You're remembering it now, aren't you?

940
00:41:26,843 --> 00:41:27,976
I bet

941
00:41:28,044 --> 00:41:32,081
your 30 seconds in Hell felt like 30 years.

942
00:41:32,148 --> 00:41:33,649
Imagine what eternity

943
00:41:33,716 --> 00:41:35,717
- would feel like.
- I'm sorry.

944
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,120
Okay?

945
00:41:38,188 --> 00:41:39,588
Sorry.

946
00:41:43,193 --> 00:41:44,426
Look...

947
00:41:44,494 --> 00:41:46,728
I got it.

948
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:48,931
An untraceable gun.

949
00:41:48,998 --> 00:41:51,333
It won't come back to me.

950
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,974
I'm ready now.

951
00:41:59,042 --> 00:42:01,677
So...

952
00:42:01,744 --> 00:42:03,745
tell me...

953
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:06,415
who do you want me to kill?

954
00:42:07,484 --> 00:42:09,418
His name...

955
00:42:10,753 --> 00:42:13,322
is Lucifer Morningstar.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>

1
00:00:00,474 --> 00:00:02,181
<i>LUCIFER: Previously on Lucifer...</i>

2
00:00:02,334 --> 00:00:05,120
- So how do you afford this place?
- It's my mother's.

3
00:00:05,257 --> 00:00:07,419
LUCIFER: Your mother's Penelope Decker,

4
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,955
queen of '80s cheeseball sci-fi?

5
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,681
You have to introduce me.

6
00:00:10,826 --> 00:00:12,620
So you're the doctor.

7
00:00:12,716 --> 00:00:14,884
You're just as Lucifer described.

8
00:00:14,951 --> 00:00:16,585
I like you.

9
00:00:16,653 --> 00:00:18,821
<i>CHLOE: Are we gonna
talk about what happened?</i>

10
00:00:18,889 --> 00:00:19,789
Our kiss.

11
00:00:19,856 --> 00:00:21,023
It's kind of a big deal.

12
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:22,358
Chloe, I have a lot on my mind.

13
00:00:22,426 --> 00:00:23,626
<i>DAN: What do you want from me Malcolm?</i>

14
00:00:23,693 --> 00:00:24,727
<i>MALCOLM: You're gonna go into evidence</i>

15
00:00:24,795 --> 00:00:26,128
<i>and borrow something for me.</i>

16
00:00:26,196 --> 00:00:27,062
Are we done?

17
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,565
Not by a long shot.

18
00:00:29,633 --> 00:00:31,467
<i>AMENADIEL: Enjoying the life I gave you?</i>

19
00:00:31,535 --> 00:00:34,336
<i>Do you want to go back?</i>

20
00:00:34,404 --> 00:00:36,539
Who do you want me to kill?

21
00:00:36,606 --> 00:00:39,542
Lucifer Morningstar.

22
00:00:43,618 --> 00:00:44,945
 Ah, ah, ah... 

23
00:00:54,525 --> 00:00:58,164
You know, there's only one way
to pick the perfect strawberry.

24
00:00:59,725 --> 00:01:01,338
Are you talking to me?

25
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,990
Yes, of course.

26
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:04,267
Why not?

27
00:01:04,338 --> 00:01:06,868
Uh, most people think it's
just about the outside.

28
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,635
You know, the, uh, shape and the color.

29
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,007
But they're just like us.

30
00:01:11,074 --> 00:01:14,910
Sneaky little devils, hiding
tasty secrets inside.

31
00:01:14,978 --> 00:01:17,813
It's never the ones you expect.

32
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:19,348
But there's no way of finding out

33
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:20,850
what deliciousness is underneath

34
00:01:20,917 --> 00:01:24,053
without giving it a little taste.

35
00:01:28,258 --> 00:01:29,458
Mmm.

36
00:01:29,526 --> 00:01:31,894
Mmm.

37
00:01:31,962 --> 00:01:32,862
You like that?

38
00:01:32,929 --> 00:01:35,130
Oh... God!

39
00:01:35,198 --> 00:01:36,665
Really?

40
00:01:36,733 --> 00:01:38,234
You have to bring him up now?

41
00:01:38,301 --> 00:01:40,236
I mean, we were having a moment.

42
00:01:40,303 --> 00:01:41,971
- Uh...
- CHLOE: Lucifer.

43
00:01:42,038 --> 00:01:44,240
The hell are you doing?

44
00:01:44,307 --> 00:01:45,941
Pardon me.

45
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:47,476
(stammering)

46
00:01:47,544 --> 00:01:49,211
LUCIFER: Right, so what have we got?

47
00:01:49,279 --> 00:01:51,480
Well, this is an interesting one.

48
00:01:51,548 --> 00:01:53,482
Our victim's a 60-year-old male.

49
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,484
Collapsed in broad daylight.

50
00:01:55,552 --> 00:01:57,753
No obvious
injuries, no sign of struggle.

51
00:01:57,821 --> 00:02:00,155
- And the interesting part is?
- (clears throat)

52
00:02:00,223 --> 00:02:01,156
This.

53
00:02:02,993 --> 00:02:04,660
Based on the bloodshot
eyes and the closed throat,

54
00:02:04,728 --> 00:02:06,695
looks like this guy was poisoned.

55
00:02:06,763 --> 00:02:08,631
No, no, no, no, no, this is horrific.

56
00:02:08,698 --> 00:02:10,499
Dead bodies don't usually affect you.

57
00:02:10,567 --> 00:02:13,035
You know who this
is? This is Chef Javier.

58
00:02:13,103 --> 00:02:14,303
Javier Arias, yeah.

59
00:02:14,371 --> 00:02:15,437
Owner of Sol De Javier.

60
00:02:15,505 --> 00:02:16,705
Did you know him?

61
00:02:16,773 --> 00:02:18,274
Well, only by his work. I
mean, this chap was, uh...

62
00:02:18,341 --> 00:02:19,842
an artist in the kitchen.

63
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,112
He made the most exquisite Mexican
cuisine I've ever had.

64
00:02:23,179 --> 00:02:24,113
And now...

65
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,214
(sighs)

66
00:02:25,282 --> 00:02:26,482
It's okay.

67
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,517
I'll never taste his
perfect tamales again.

68
00:02:28,585 --> 00:02:30,619
So this isn't about the
man, this is about your stomach.

69
00:02:30,687 --> 00:02:33,155
This is about a crime against
good taste, Detective.

70
00:02:33,223 --> 00:02:35,124
Well, someone definitely
needs to be punished for this.

71
00:02:35,191 --> 00:02:38,318
According to the grocers,
he came here every morning

72
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,395
after having
breakfast at his restaurant.

73
00:02:39,462 --> 00:02:40,942
M.E. says that the poisoning happened

74
00:02:40,997 --> 00:02:42,665
about 90 minutes before he fell,

75
00:02:42,732 --> 00:02:44,133
which puts him
squarely at the restaurant.

76
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,542
Well, you can't think his
own staff poisoned him.

77
00:02:46,707 --> 00:02:47,987
I mean, the man was a visionary.

78
00:02:48,004 --> 00:02:49,939
With a hell of a
temper, by all accounts.

79
00:02:50,006 --> 00:02:51,206
Everyone at the restaurant's a suspect.

80
00:02:51,274 --> 00:02:53,142
We need to
interview all of his employees

81
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:54,543
and do a full sweep for toxins.

82
00:02:54,611 --> 00:02:58,180
And find out whether he
wrote down his recipes.

83
00:02:58,248 --> 00:03:00,749
 

84
00:03:00,817 --> 00:03:02,952
(indistinct radio chatter)

85
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:04,753
You smell that?

86
00:03:04,821 --> 00:03:08,290
It's the last of Chef
Javier's brilliance gone forever.

87
00:03:08,358 --> 00:03:11,760
I wonder if police recovered
any leftovers from his last meal.

88
00:03:11,828 --> 00:03:13,329
Well, it was most likely poisoned.

89
00:03:13,396 --> 00:03:14,997
Ah, well, it's well worth the risk.

90
00:03:15,065 --> 00:03:17,566
Hi. So is this everyone that works here?

91
00:03:17,634 --> 00:03:19,301
Yeah, that's everybody.

92
00:03:19,369 --> 00:03:21,370
You think one of us killed Pops?

93
00:03:21,438 --> 00:03:22,638
"Pops"?

94
00:03:22,706 --> 00:03:24,907
What, are you his daughter or something?

95
00:03:24,975 --> 00:03:27,643
Uh, no, that's what we all called him.

96
00:03:27,711 --> 00:03:29,545
We were like a family here.

97
00:03:29,613 --> 00:03:32,648
Well, hold on, so everyone
here saw him as a father figure?

98
00:03:33,783 --> 00:03:36,952
Oh, this is much more interesting now.

99
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,053
Why is that?

100
00:03:38,121 --> 00:03:41,490
Well, my dear
detective, this is patricide.

101
00:03:41,558 --> 00:03:43,492
It's a tale as old as time.

102
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,160
You know, Oedipus, the
Menendez brothers,

103
00:03:45,195 --> 00:03:46,328
Voldemort.

104
00:03:46,396 --> 00:03:48,030
Okay.

105
00:03:48,098 --> 00:03:49,131
Yes.

106
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,499
I know after what
happened to Father Frank,

107
00:03:50,567 --> 00:03:52,267
you're mad at, um...

108
00:03:52,335 --> 00:03:53,402
You can say it.

109
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,104
- God.
- My dad.

110
00:03:55,171 --> 00:03:56,772
Sure.

111
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,174
I just don't want you projecting
onto this case.

112
00:03:59,242 --> 00:04:01,110
There are so many
reasons to commit murder.

113
00:04:01,177 --> 00:04:04,847
Don't let your, um, daddy
issues cloud your judgment.

114
00:04:04,914 --> 00:04:07,116
No, no, no, I simply understand
what it's like

115
00:04:07,183 --> 00:04:09,263
to want to escape the
clutches of a difficult father.

116
00:04:09,285 --> 00:04:10,519
That's all.

117
00:04:10,587 --> 00:04:13,522
Lucifer, not
everything's about your parents.

118
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,823
- (scoffs)
- Hey, Detective.

119
00:04:14,891 --> 00:04:15,858
Yeah.

120
00:04:15,925 --> 00:04:17,192
Your sister's here to see you.

121
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,360
Oh, no, no.

122
00:04:18,428 --> 00:04:19,228
I don't... I don't have a sister.

123
00:04:19,295 --> 00:04:20,195
So it can't...

124
00:04:20,263 --> 00:04:21,630
Oh, no.

125
00:04:21,698 --> 00:04:24,466
Hi, sweetie, guess who's back.

126
00:04:24,534 --> 00:04:26,702
Oh, what a pleasant surprise.

127
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,272
Detective, you never told me
you had such a radiant sister.

128
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,674
It's 'cause I don't.

129
00:04:31,741 --> 00:04:34,243
And who is this handsome devil?

130
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,544
No way.

131
00:04:35,612 --> 00:04:36,512
Mom, this is Lucifer.

132
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:37,546
Lucifer, Mom.

133
00:04:37,614 --> 00:04:39,682
Sorry, I'm a bit speechless, I...

134
00:04:40,417 --> 00:04:41,917
Penelope Decker?

135
00:04:41,985 --> 00:04:42,985
Well...

136
00:04:43,053 --> 00:04:44,019
As I live and breathe?

137
00:04:44,087 --> 00:04:45,120
The Vampire Queen?

138
00:04:45,188 --> 00:04:46,055
- Yeah.
- (laughs)

139
00:04:46,122 --> 00:04:48,810
Wow, are you a real vampire?

140
00:04:48,811 --> 00:04:50,155
'Cause you certainly
don't look old enough

141
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:51,360
- to have a daughter this age.
- (laughs)

142
00:04:51,428 --> 00:04:53,495
How old are you, Detective?

143
00:04:53,563 --> 00:04:56,331
Honey, your new
friend is just delicious.

144
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,332
Oh, stop.

145
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,967
Mom, what are you doing here?

146
00:04:59,035 --> 00:05:00,369
Oh, well, you know how exhausting

147
00:05:00,437 --> 00:05:02,104
those convention circuits can be.

148
00:05:02,172 --> 00:05:03,839
I just wanted to get home.

149
00:05:03,907 --> 00:05:06,675
Mom, I mean here, at my job.

150
00:05:06,743 --> 00:05:09,912
(gasps) Oh, well, you
weren't answering your phone...

151
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:12,614
- Uh, yep.
- so I called someone at the department.

152
00:05:12,682 --> 00:05:14,450
I can be very persuasive.

153
00:05:14,517 --> 00:05:16,418
Oh, you clever little minx.

154
00:05:16,486 --> 00:05:19,388
Besides, it's all over the news.

155
00:05:19,456 --> 00:05:20,656
Poor Javier.

156
00:05:20,724 --> 00:05:22,558
Such a wonderful chef.

157
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,560
A woman of refined taste as well.

158
00:05:24,627 --> 00:05:26,195
(laughing) I mean...

159
00:05:26,262 --> 00:05:27,896
What happened to you?

160
00:05:27,964 --> 00:05:31,700
So you think one of these
people might have done it?

161
00:05:31,768 --> 00:05:33,488
- Yes, uh...
- Mom, can we talk about this later?

162
00:05:33,503 --> 00:05:34,703
Well, sure.

163
00:05:34,771 --> 00:05:37,206
What about a family dinner tonight?

164
00:05:37,273 --> 00:05:38,607
CHLOE: Family dinner?

165
00:05:38,675 --> 00:05:40,042
That's right, it's been ages.

166
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,211
Age...? We never had...

167
00:05:42,278 --> 00:05:45,080
And, Lucifer, you have to come.

168
00:05:45,148 --> 00:05:46,715
- No, that's really not necessary.
- LUCIFER: I'd love to.

169
00:05:46,783 --> 00:05:47,750
PENELOPE: Oh, great!

170
00:05:47,817 --> 00:05:50,152
Well, then I'll see you both

171
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,154
tonight.

172
00:05:52,222 --> 00:05:53,689
I love you, pumpkin.

173
00:05:53,757 --> 00:05:55,324
- (chuckles)
- Ooh!

174
00:05:55,391 --> 00:05:57,526
Mama Decker.

175
00:05:59,395 --> 00:06:01,463
- (sighs) Okay.
- Mmm.

176
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:03,999
- Hey.
- Hmm?

177
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:05,267
Crime scene?

178
00:06:05,335 --> 00:06:06,535
Oh. Yes, of course.

179
00:06:06,603 --> 00:06:08,537
Right, well, where do we begin?

180
00:06:08,605 --> 00:06:10,272
Well, we know it was poison,

181
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,440
we know it was here,

182
00:06:11,508 --> 00:06:12,708
so we have to go
through anyone and everyone

183
00:06:12,776 --> 00:06:14,176
that could have had their hands

184
00:06:14,244 --> 00:06:15,444
on Javier's last meal.

185
00:06:15,512 --> 00:06:17,446
That's chefs, servers, bussers.

186
00:06:17,514 --> 00:06:19,314
Even the dishwasher could have done it.

187
00:06:19,382 --> 00:06:21,316
Oh, so many people,

188
00:06:21,384 --> 00:06:23,952
so many reasons to kill Pops.

190
00:06:37,224 --> 00:06:38,791
WOMAN: I loved him.

191
00:06:38,859 --> 00:06:40,827
Pops was like a father to me.

192
00:06:40,894 --> 00:06:42,295
He was such a nice man.

193
00:06:42,363 --> 00:06:44,030
Except when you made a mistake.

194
00:06:44,098 --> 00:06:45,365
WOMAN 2: That's right.

195
00:06:45,432 --> 00:06:48,034
Then he got upset, and he threw things.

196
00:06:48,102 --> 00:06:51,270
He threw things... a lot.

197
00:06:51,338 --> 00:06:53,473
- Where were you this morning?
- Here.

198
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,141
I'm always here.

199
00:06:55,209 --> 00:06:56,609
Pops worked me to the bone.

200
00:06:56,677 --> 00:06:58,111
A taskmaster, was he?

201
00:06:58,178 --> 00:07:00,646
No matter what you gave
him, it wasn't enough?

202
00:07:00,714 --> 00:07:02,181
It wasn't.

203
00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:03,649
And I gave him a lot.

204
00:07:06,754 --> 00:07:09,889
Ah, to the bone, indeed.

205
00:07:09,957 --> 00:07:11,657
Did you have any altercations with Pops?

206
00:07:11,725 --> 00:07:13,493
- Sure.
- All the time.

207
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,029
Nothing I did was ever
good enough for Pops.

208
00:07:16,096 --> 00:07:17,730
And it never would be, would it?

209
00:07:17,798 --> 00:07:20,600
Which is why he left you
with no choice but to take matters

210
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:22,201
into your own hands.

211
00:07:22,269 --> 00:07:23,870
He was like a father to me.

212
00:07:23,937 --> 00:07:25,705
He was like a father to me...

213
00:07:25,773 --> 00:07:27,407
He was like a father to me.

214
00:07:30,077 --> 00:07:31,477
And how was he to everyone else?

215
00:07:31,545 --> 00:07:34,847
Tough, but, ultimately, he was fair.

216
00:07:34,915 --> 00:07:36,816
Uh, he cared about his people.

217
00:07:36,884 --> 00:07:37,950
He was...

218
00:07:38,018 --> 00:07:38,985
"Like a father to you."

219
00:07:39,053 --> 00:07:40,753
Yes, we've heard that one before.

220
00:07:40,821 --> 00:07:42,655
He was my father.

221
00:07:43,991 --> 00:07:45,691
This is Javier's son, Junior.

222
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,360
I don't work here anymore.

223
00:07:47,428 --> 00:07:49,629
I-I've been away a while.

224
00:07:49,696 --> 00:07:52,331
I came over as soon as I got the call.

225
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:54,133
(chuckles)

226
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:56,102
I still can't believe he's gone, man.

227
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,171
Wayward son, are you?

228
00:07:58,238 --> 00:08:00,206
Yeah, you could say that.

229
00:08:00,274 --> 00:08:02,642
You and your father had
a strained relationship?

230
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:05,945
It's... it's complicated.

231
00:08:06,013 --> 00:08:08,481
You know, I feel like the only thing

232
00:08:08,549 --> 00:08:10,483
that made him happy was this place.

233
00:08:10,551 --> 00:08:13,886
So let me guess, you tried
to follow in his footsteps?

234
00:08:13,954 --> 00:08:15,354
Yeah, I trained as a chef, yeah.

235
00:08:15,422 --> 00:08:18,391
And Dad was domineering, acted
like a god in the kitchen?

236
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:19,659
Lucifer.

237
00:08:19,726 --> 00:08:21,527
You have no idea.

238
00:08:21,595 --> 00:08:23,162
Oh, you'd be surprised.

239
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,364
I was never gonna live
up to him, so I just, I...

240
00:08:25,432 --> 00:08:27,300
Rejected everything he stood for.

241
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:28,367
Yeah.

242
00:08:28,435 --> 00:08:31,504
I gave up cooking, I hit the road...

243
00:08:31,572 --> 00:08:33,731
Which is why I'm
curious about your return.

244
00:08:33,732 --> 00:08:37,276
Was there something that you wanted
to do when you came back?

245
00:08:37,344 --> 00:08:39,979
Uh, I don't know, like...

246
00:08:40,047 --> 00:08:41,280
Oh, come now.

247
00:08:41,348 --> 00:08:44,250
The prodigal son returns
to his overbearing father.

248
00:08:44,318 --> 00:08:47,120
What could you possibly desire?

249
00:08:48,989 --> 00:08:51,190
I wanted...

250
00:08:51,258 --> 00:08:52,391
Yes?

251
00:08:53,827 --> 00:08:56,662
To have one more meal with my dad.

252
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,365
(Chloe clears throat)

253
00:09:02,169 --> 00:09:04,103
(sighs) So you just
got into town last night?

254
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:06,472
Yeah, I-I met Dad here for breakfast.

255
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,175
Did you notice anything
strange about him or the meal?

256
00:09:09,243 --> 00:09:10,810
Anything?

257
00:09:10,878 --> 00:09:12,612
Dad had them bring out our usual.

258
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:15,114
(chuckles) We were
actually getting along for once.

259
00:09:15,182 --> 00:09:17,016
Uh, after we finished eating,

260
00:09:17,084 --> 00:09:19,085
Dad left to do his pickup at the market.

261
00:09:19,153 --> 00:09:20,793
We were supposed to meet
up later tonight.

262
00:09:20,854 --> 00:09:22,814
Said he had something he
wanted to tell me, but...

263
00:09:22,856 --> 00:09:24,357
So now that Dad's gone,

264
00:09:24,424 --> 00:09:26,225
I'm guessing the restaurant goes to you?

265
00:09:26,293 --> 00:09:28,895
No, I don't... I don't
deserve this place.

266
00:09:29,963 --> 00:09:31,531
Dad knew that.

267
00:09:31,598 --> 00:09:33,099
(chuckles)

268
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:34,133
Well, stay in town.

269
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:35,601
We may have more questions for you.

270
00:09:38,438 --> 00:09:39,438
LUCIFER: Well.

271
00:09:39,506 --> 00:09:41,607
Isn't that a coincidence?

272
00:09:41,675 --> 00:09:42,909
Boy returns home,

273
00:09:42,976 --> 00:09:46,012
and, conveniently, his
pops drops the next day?

274
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:48,414
(sighs) Lucky bastard.

275
00:09:48,482 --> 00:09:50,516
Maybe.

276
00:09:50,584 --> 00:09:52,818
Or maybe this is about something
more than anger,

277
00:09:52,886 --> 00:09:54,320
which they all had,

278
00:09:54,388 --> 00:09:57,657
but if Junior isn't
inheriting the restaurant, then who is?

279
00:10:01,395 --> 00:10:03,329
<i>LINDA: Well, I'm glad you
decided to come here,</i>

280
00:10:03,397 --> 00:10:07,533
but I'm not sure this is appropriate.

281
00:10:07,601 --> 00:10:08,868
Why?

282
00:10:08,936 --> 00:10:12,004
Well, Lucifer's your
boss and a client of mine.

283
00:10:12,072 --> 00:10:14,373
I can recommend you to someone else.

284
00:10:14,441 --> 00:10:16,576
No, I like you.

285
00:10:16,643 --> 00:10:18,744
Look, you helped Lucifer,
and I need you to help me.

286
00:10:18,812 --> 00:10:20,713
(sighs)

287
00:10:20,781 --> 00:10:22,381
What seems to be the problem?

288
00:10:23,884 --> 00:10:25,318
(sighs)

289
00:10:25,385 --> 00:10:27,587
I'm stuck in a place I don't belong,

290
00:10:27,654 --> 00:10:29,889
and I'm not going anywhere anytime soon.

291
00:10:29,957 --> 00:10:32,124
I need to figure out

292
00:10:32,192 --> 00:10:33,326
how to be more...

293
00:10:35,395 --> 00:10:36,796
normal.

294
00:10:36,863 --> 00:10:38,764
So...

295
00:10:38,832 --> 00:10:40,566
"So" what?

296
00:10:40,634 --> 00:10:43,069
Tell me what to do.

297
00:10:43,136 --> 00:10:45,504
Well, that's not how this works.

298
00:10:47,174 --> 00:10:49,242
Do I need to sleep with you too?

299
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:50,576
What?

300
00:10:50,644 --> 00:10:52,478
Is that it?

301
00:10:52,546 --> 00:10:53,613
Uh, no.

302
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,680
No, I'm good.

303
00:10:54,748 --> 00:10:55,615
I'm good.

304
00:10:55,682 --> 00:10:57,683
Really, I'm good.

305
00:10:57,751 --> 00:11:01,387
What I can give you...

306
00:11:01,455 --> 00:11:04,590
is my advice.

307
00:11:04,658 --> 00:11:07,293
So... if we want to feel
more connected to our environment,

308
00:11:07,361 --> 00:11:08,694
sometimes it's helpful

309
00:11:08,762 --> 00:11:12,098
if we actively embrace
it and those around you.

310
00:11:12,165 --> 00:11:14,133
That still sounds like sex.

311
00:11:14,201 --> 00:11:17,503
Okay. I meant, uh, engage in

312
00:11:17,571 --> 00:11:21,307
caring and meaningful relationships.

313
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,542
Making friends.

314
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:24,677
Forget it.

315
00:11:24,745 --> 00:11:25,811
This was a mistake.

316
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:26,846
Mazikeen.

317
00:11:26,913 --> 00:11:28,014
Wait. If you could...

318
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,051
What just happened?

319
00:11:32,119 --> 00:11:34,487
 

320
00:11:34,554 --> 00:11:37,523
Something on your mind, partner?

321
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:40,379
What's the gun for, Malcolm?

322
00:11:40,427 --> 00:11:43,429
Oh, you mean that gun you stole for me?

323
00:11:43,497 --> 00:11:44,964
That gun?

324
00:11:45,032 --> 00:11:46,299
I was wondering when you'd ask.

325
00:11:46,366 --> 00:11:47,333
You know what?

326
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:49,068
I'm done playing your stupid games.

327
00:11:49,136 --> 00:11:50,970
You want to tell everyone I shot you,

328
00:11:51,038 --> 00:11:52,772
you go right ahead.

329
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:55,174
But I'm gonna put an end to
whatever you're planning.

330
00:11:55,242 --> 00:11:56,776
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

331
00:11:56,843 --> 00:11:57,910
Hey, chill, Dan.

332
00:11:57,978 --> 00:12:01,013
God, you went from zero to 100 so fast.

333
00:12:01,081 --> 00:12:02,248
The way I see it,

334
00:12:02,316 --> 00:12:03,983
I'm doing you a favor.

335
00:12:04,051 --> 00:12:05,757
(chuckles) A favor?

336
00:12:05,908 --> 00:12:07,887
Another man spends so
much time with my wife,

337
00:12:07,954 --> 00:12:09,722
I sure wouldn't like it.

338
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,525
Especially knowing this
guy's so dangerous.

339
00:12:14,328 --> 00:12:16,095
You want to kill Lucifer?

340
00:12:16,163 --> 00:12:17,763
Why?

341
00:12:17,831 --> 00:12:19,498
If I told you,

342
00:12:19,566 --> 00:12:20,933
I promise,

343
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:22,535
you wouldn't believe me.

344
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,471
But before you go

345
00:12:25,539 --> 00:12:28,674
growing any more balls, remember this...

346
00:12:28,742 --> 00:12:29,787
(sighs)

347
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:31,477
You thinking about taking
another shot at me,

348
00:12:31,545 --> 00:12:33,479
try to take me down?

349
00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:37,550
Don't miss.

350
00:12:40,687 --> 00:12:43,189
So you're Anne Martin, the sous chef.

351
00:12:43,256 --> 00:12:44,336
You're Javier's number two?

352
00:12:44,391 --> 00:12:45,691
ANNE: I mean, I guess I was.

353
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:48,361
I mean, I-I can't believe it.

354
00:12:48,428 --> 00:12:50,262
I... I just saw Pops this morning.

355
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,464
He was fine.

356
00:12:51,531 --> 00:12:53,251
And you cooked his last
meal, is that right?

357
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,600
So?

358
00:12:54,668 --> 00:12:56,828
You know how many people
had their hands on that plate?

359
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,404
Well, this is your kitchen, Anne.

360
00:12:58,472 --> 00:13:00,032
When Pops isn't here, you run the show.

361
00:13:00,073 --> 00:13:01,173
And from what I understand,

362
00:13:01,241 --> 00:13:03,259
you're not someone to
be messed with, so...

363
00:13:03,388 --> 00:13:05,378
you really think
someone's gonna go behind your back?

364
00:13:05,445 --> 00:13:06,979
I can't control what they do.

365
00:13:07,047 --> 00:13:08,781
Who knows what kind of psychos we have?

366
00:13:08,849 --> 00:13:10,049
Well, are any of these psychos

367
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,770
set to inherit the
restaurant, like you are?

368
00:13:12,619 --> 00:13:13,953
I spoke to his estate attorney.

369
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,989
It's no secret Javier was
grooming me to take over.

370
00:13:17,057 --> 00:13:18,524
He was my mentor.

371
00:13:18,592 --> 00:13:20,326
Well, of all the reasons to
kill your father figure,

372
00:13:20,394 --> 00:13:22,027
greed is truly the ugliest.

373
00:13:22,095 --> 00:13:24,497
You think I killed Pops to
speed up my inheritance?

374
00:13:24,564 --> 00:13:26,832
I would never do anything to hurt him.

375
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,967
He taught me everything.

376
00:13:28,034 --> 00:13:29,101
He meant the world
to me. (phone buzzing)

377
00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:32,204
LUCIFER: Well...

378
00:13:32,272 --> 00:13:33,992
If you didn't wish your
dear old "Pops" ill,

379
00:13:34,007 --> 00:13:36,509
what did you wish?

380
00:13:36,576 --> 00:13:38,844
To surpass him.

381
00:13:38,912 --> 00:13:40,212
Ah! So the student

382
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,814
becomes the master, eh?

383
00:13:41,882 --> 00:13:43,249
What? No! It's not like that.

384
00:13:43,316 --> 00:13:44,583
CHLOE: Preliminary tox screen came in.

385
00:13:44,651 --> 00:13:47,253
The poison used to
kill Javier was mercury.

386
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,354
Oh.

387
00:13:48,422 --> 00:13:49,655
So you cracked open a few thermometers

388
00:13:49,723 --> 00:13:50,923
over brunch, did you?

389
00:13:50,991 --> 00:13:53,025
Not the trick I'd
use, but clearly effective.

390
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:55,161
There was something
else in his system, too.

391
00:13:55,228 --> 00:13:56,548
Can I see the inside of your arms?

392
00:13:56,563 --> 00:13:57,596
Why?

393
00:13:57,664 --> 00:13:58,631
Track marks.

394
00:13:58,698 --> 00:14:00,266
Ah, so there was heroin as well?

395
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,001
Generous killer, aren't you?

396
00:14:02,068 --> 00:14:04,003
Wanted to give him a
little high on the way out?

397
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,471
This is crazy. No. If you...

398
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:07,873
if it's heroin, you should talk to...

399
00:14:07,941 --> 00:14:09,608
I'm sorry.

400
00:14:09,676 --> 00:14:10,843
Don't worry.

401
00:14:10,911 --> 00:14:12,745
I tend to have a rather
striking effect on women.

402
00:14:12,813 --> 00:14:13,913
Come on.

403
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,781
Just let it all out.

404
00:14:15,849 --> 00:14:17,183
Oh!

405
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,919
Okay.

406
00:14:19,986 --> 00:14:21,353
Someone call an ambulance!

407
00:14:21,421 --> 00:14:23,509
Well, I've never had that effect.

408
00:14:34,376 --> 00:14:36,110
Do you still think she's a suspect?

409
00:14:36,178 --> 00:14:37,658
We can arrest her now, if you'd like.

410
00:14:37,713 --> 00:14:40,047
You know, once she's done
getting her stomach pumped.

411
00:14:40,115 --> 00:14:41,716
What I want to know is...

412
00:14:41,783 --> 00:14:43,783
did she ingest the same
thing as Javier by mistake?

413
00:14:43,785 --> 00:14:46,887
Or was she poisoned, too?

414
00:14:46,955 --> 00:14:48,189
Why did she survive?

415
00:14:48,256 --> 00:14:50,825
Well, perhaps the killer
simply ran out of thermometers.

416
00:14:50,892 --> 00:14:52,226
Who would have a bone to pick

417
00:14:52,294 --> 00:14:53,794
with Javier and his number two?

418
00:14:53,862 --> 00:14:55,096
Oh, I don't know.

419
00:14:55,163 --> 00:14:56,697
Perhaps someone who was kicked
out of the family biz?

420
00:14:56,765 --> 00:14:58,065
You mean Junior.

421
00:14:58,133 --> 00:15:00,234
Well, he seemed like a
very troubled young man to me.

422
00:15:00,302 --> 00:15:01,369
Yeah.

423
00:15:01,436 --> 00:15:03,304
It's almost as if his dad just died.

424
00:15:04,706 --> 00:15:06,906
Oh, and look who decided to
grace us with his douchedom.

425
00:15:06,908 --> 00:15:08,009
Daniel...

426
00:15:08,076 --> 00:15:10,277
Hey. Did you find something?

427
00:15:10,345 --> 00:15:11,712
A Naomi Austen.

428
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,281
She worked as a hostess here
last year till she was fired.

429
00:15:14,349 --> 00:15:16,117
She has two arrests
for heroin possession

430
00:15:16,184 --> 00:15:17,351
over the last year alone.

431
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:19,820
Poor girl doesn't
learn her lesson, does she?

432
00:15:19,888 --> 00:15:20,855
Naomi Austen.

433
00:15:20,922 --> 00:15:22,323
That name sounds familiar.

434
00:15:22,391 --> 00:15:23,991
Oh, okay.

435
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:26,560
So one of the cooks said
that she showed up two days ago,

436
00:15:26,628 --> 00:15:28,429
and was yelling at
Javier and Anne, so...

437
00:15:28,497 --> 00:15:30,464
I'll see if her P.O. has an address.

438
00:15:30,532 --> 00:15:32,199
It's already in the file.

439
00:15:32,267 --> 00:15:33,827
Look at you two, like Cagney and Lacey.

440
00:15:33,835 --> 00:15:36,404
You don't care who you piss off, do you?

441
00:15:36,471 --> 00:15:37,538
Not in the slightest, no.

442
00:15:37,606 --> 00:15:39,206
(under breath) Oh, my God.

443
00:15:39,274 --> 00:15:40,241
Oh, wait!

444
00:15:40,308 --> 00:15:41,909
Um, Dan. Um...

445
00:15:44,446 --> 00:15:45,646
So, uh, if you don't have plans tonight,

446
00:15:45,714 --> 00:15:48,783
my mom is having this family dinner...

447
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,951
And you could really use a buffer.

448
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:52,386
Yeah.

449
00:15:52,454 --> 00:15:54,321
Sure. Send me the details.

450
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:55,489
All right.

451
00:15:55,557 --> 00:15:57,224
LUCIFER: Detective...

452
00:15:57,292 --> 00:15:59,060
do you mind if we
make a stop on the way?

453
00:15:59,127 --> 00:16:01,462
I mean, this shirt's more
of a loaner, really.

454
00:16:02,998 --> 00:16:04,932
(buzzing)

455
00:16:08,937 --> 00:16:11,672
(Chloe sighs)

456
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,474
Still no answer.

457
00:16:16,378 --> 00:16:19,246
OJ... spoons, foil.

458
00:16:19,314 --> 00:16:20,614
Looks like a junkie...

459
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,788
What do you think you're doing?

460
00:16:27,856 --> 00:16:30,124
Well, I found
something far more interesting.

461
00:16:30,192 --> 00:16:31,292
We don't have a warrant.

462
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:32,860
We don't have time for
warrants, Detective!

463
00:16:32,928 --> 00:16:35,129
Look. Junior was here.

464
00:16:35,197 --> 00:16:36,263
Junior was staying here?

465
00:16:37,265 --> 00:16:38,799
He and Naomi must be close.

466
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:40,334
Yeah, well, they probably
chased the dragon together

467
00:16:40,402 --> 00:16:41,602
after Junior killed his dad

468
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,871
and then sat and
looked at the twinkly lights.

469
00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:45,819
Why have they still got
their Christmas tree up?

470
00:16:45,874 --> 00:16:47,108
We don't know what happened.

471
00:16:47,175 --> 00:16:49,009
Well, maybe something in
here will help clear that up.

472
00:16:49,077 --> 00:16:51,612
Right. Uh...

473
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:54,949
Board shorts.

474
00:16:55,016 --> 00:16:56,984
Don't know what more proof
you need that he's deranged.

475
00:16:57,052 --> 00:16:59,053
We're not supposed to be in here.

476
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:00,588
Oh, come on.

477
00:17:00,655 --> 00:17:01,856
(sighs)

478
00:17:01,923 --> 00:17:04,358
So let's just search the place fast.

479
00:17:04,426 --> 00:17:06,060
Oh! Well, well.

480
00:17:06,128 --> 00:17:07,862
Lead the way, Detective.

481
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:09,463
All right.

482
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,034
(couple moaning in
pleasure, bed springs squeaking)

483
00:17:14,102 --> 00:17:15,469
Oh... I... can...

484
00:17:15,537 --> 00:17:16,637
can you hear that?

485
00:17:16,705 --> 00:17:19,073
Yeah. And since when
has that bothered you?

486
00:17:19,141 --> 00:17:20,441
WOMAN: Oh, God!

487
00:17:20,509 --> 00:17:22,042
And dear old Dad strikes again.

488
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,911
- I mean...
- (giggles)

489
00:17:23,979 --> 00:17:25,579
- It's not funny.
- It's kind of funny.

490
00:17:25,647 --> 00:17:26,967
Well, that's easy for you to say.

491
00:17:27,015 --> 00:17:28,516
You're not the one being
taunted, are you?

492
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,684
"Oh, God" this! "Oh, God" that!

493
00:17:30,752 --> 00:17:33,420
He's popping up everywhere and
spoiling my favorite things!

494
00:17:33,488 --> 00:17:35,589
I'd really hate to be in your head.

495
00:17:35,657 --> 00:17:36,757
Well, why would you understand?

496
00:17:36,825 --> 00:17:38,759
Your mother's absolutely delightful.

497
00:17:38,827 --> 00:17:40,628
<i>Oh, of course you think she is.</i>

498
00:17:40,695 --> 00:17:41,428
Oh...

499
00:17:41,496 --> 00:17:43,364
Do I detect some angst?

500
00:17:46,234 --> 00:17:47,802
She's like a child.

501
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:49,570
- Oh, and I bet it drove you crazy.
- Yeah.

502
00:17:49,638 --> 00:17:52,339
All she wanted was to doll me
up and take me to auditions.

503
00:17:52,407 --> 00:17:54,141
Would make anyone mad with rage.

504
00:17:54,209 --> 00:17:55,609
She made everything about her.

505
00:17:55,677 --> 00:17:58,579
So you could just murder her!

506
00:17:58,647 --> 00:17:59,713
Sure.

507
00:17:59,781 --> 00:18:01,048
But I didn't.

508
00:18:01,116 --> 00:18:03,083
And you're still not
proving your point about Junior.

509
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:04,718
(sighs)

510
00:18:04,786 --> 00:18:05,686
Fair enough.

511
00:18:05,754 --> 00:18:07,822
So how did you handle it, anyway?

512
00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:09,790
You know, besides taking your
anger out on criminals?

513
00:18:09,858 --> 00:18:11,158
I don't know.

514
00:18:11,226 --> 00:18:14,195
I guess I just always tried to

515
00:18:14,262 --> 00:18:17,598
focus on something else.

516
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:18,866
This is...

517
00:18:18,934 --> 00:18:20,334
weird.

518
00:18:28,577 --> 00:18:29,643
Well! That painting

519
00:18:29,711 --> 00:18:31,612
just became far more valuable.

520
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,880
- (door opens)
- Oh.

521
00:18:34,182 --> 00:18:35,916
Hello, Naomi.

522
00:18:35,984 --> 00:18:37,084
Who the hell are you?

523
00:18:37,152 --> 00:18:38,085
Heroin inspector.

524
00:18:38,153 --> 00:18:39,320
I'm afraid your spoons

525
00:18:39,387 --> 00:18:41,088
aren't up to standard, so...

526
00:18:41,156 --> 00:18:42,423
Hold on.

527
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,024
We have some questions for you.

528
00:18:46,294 --> 00:18:47,728
<i>NAOMI: You think I killed Javier?</i>

529
00:18:47,796 --> 00:18:49,697
Well, I don't. But she definitely does.

530
00:18:49,764 --> 00:18:51,332
But she thought it
was the sous chef before,

531
00:18:51,399 --> 00:18:52,519
so don't take it personally.

532
00:18:52,534 --> 00:18:53,834
(Chloe clears throat)

533
00:18:55,403 --> 00:18:57,771
The poison that killed
Javier was laced with heroin.

534
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:59,807
We know you use and we
know that you had a fight

535
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:02,810
with Javier and Anne
Martin two days ago.

536
00:19:02,878 --> 00:19:03,777
Okay, I admit,

537
00:19:03,845 --> 00:19:05,779
I went to see Pops a few days ago,

538
00:19:05,847 --> 00:19:07,381
'cause Junior called me to tell me

539
00:19:07,449 --> 00:19:09,316
he was coming back home.

540
00:19:09,384 --> 00:19:11,919
I just wanted to make
peace with his dad.

541
00:19:11,987 --> 00:19:13,053
Make peace? Why?

542
00:19:13,121 --> 00:19:14,820
Because he didn't want us together.

543
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,550
- So you're dating Junior.
- We were.

544
00:19:16,591 --> 00:19:18,726
A year ago, before he left.

545
00:19:18,793 --> 00:19:22,897
And I thought,
maybe, when he came back...

546
00:19:22,964 --> 00:19:24,498
But Pops never approved.

547
00:19:24,566 --> 00:19:26,400
Well, I can't see why they're not fans

548
00:19:26,468 --> 00:19:28,669
of your whole Kurt and Courtney vibe.

549
00:19:28,737 --> 00:19:31,005
I tried to tell him that
Junior got clean on his travels,

550
00:19:31,072 --> 00:19:32,840
but it didn't matter.

551
00:19:32,908 --> 00:19:35,109
Javier said he would never support us.

552
00:19:35,176 --> 00:19:36,377
I got upset.

553
00:19:36,444 --> 00:19:37,884
What happened with you at breakfast?

554
00:19:37,913 --> 00:19:40,014
Nothing.

555
00:19:40,081 --> 00:19:41,415
I wasn't even at breakfast.

556
00:19:41,483 --> 00:19:43,617
Junior wanted to see his dad alone.

557
00:19:43,685 --> 00:19:45,052
I went to see my sponsor.

558
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,054
I've been having a
tough time of it lately.

559
00:19:47,122 --> 00:19:48,555
All right.

560
00:19:48,623 --> 00:19:49,690
Until we can confirm that,

561
00:19:49,758 --> 00:19:51,358
we need you to come down to the station.

562
00:19:51,393 --> 00:19:52,826
Why, pray tell,

563
00:19:52,894 --> 00:19:54,895
did Junior want to see his dad alone?

564
00:19:54,963 --> 00:19:57,064
He just said that he
wanted to make it right.

565
00:19:57,132 --> 00:19:58,632
That all he needed to do

566
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,335
was confront his
father and settle things.

567
00:20:01,403 --> 00:20:03,504
- (laughs)
- Hmm.

568
00:20:03,571 --> 00:20:05,239
You don't think that...

569
00:20:05,307 --> 00:20:06,640
He killed him?

570
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:09,476
Junior told us he wanted to
have one more meal with his dad.

571
00:20:09,544 --> 00:20:10,945
It seems he did...

572
00:20:11,012 --> 00:20:12,579
a rather final one.

573
00:20:14,249 --> 00:20:15,416
Do you know where he is?

574
00:20:15,483 --> 00:20:18,585
I haven't talked to
him since this morning.

575
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:24,491
CHLOE: APB on Junior's out.

576
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:25,960
We're trying to ping his cell.

577
00:20:26,027 --> 00:20:28,095
I'm glad we're finally on the same page.

578
00:20:28,163 --> 00:20:29,697
You know, ever since we met this kid,

579
00:20:29,764 --> 00:20:31,365
you've had it in for him. Why?

580
00:20:31,433 --> 00:20:33,834
Guess he's a bird of a feather.

581
00:20:33,902 --> 00:20:36,704
Someone who had a shadow cast
over him his entire life.

582
00:20:36,771 --> 00:20:38,238
Whereas I could never
escape from under mine...

583
00:20:38,306 --> 00:20:39,974
he could.

584
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,042
I wonder how that feels.

585
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,043
(phone rings)

586
00:20:43,111 --> 00:20:44,812
Decker.

587
00:20:46,414 --> 00:20:48,115
No. No, you did the right thing.

588
00:20:48,183 --> 00:20:49,016
I'm on my way.

589
00:20:49,084 --> 00:20:50,184
Did they find Junior?

590
00:20:50,251 --> 00:20:51,151
No. I gotta go.

591
00:20:51,219 --> 00:20:52,252
But we've a killer to catch!

592
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,887
And we will. This is an emergency.

593
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,557
(knocking) Detective!

594
00:20:56,624 --> 00:20:58,058
Come on!

595
00:20:58,126 --> 00:20:59,026
Oh...

596
00:20:59,094 --> 00:21:01,562
(tires squealing)

597
00:21:01,629 --> 00:21:04,665
You've got to stop doing that!

598
00:21:06,768 --> 00:21:07,701
(sighs)

599
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:08,836
Oh, no.

600
00:21:08,903 --> 00:21:11,672
Nana says we're gonna be in a movie!

601
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,906
(scoffs)

602
00:21:12,974 --> 00:21:14,675
PENELOPE: No, no, no.

603
00:21:16,077 --> 00:21:18,379
So the babysitter called

604
00:21:18,446 --> 00:21:20,547
and said that you let her off early.

605
00:21:20,615 --> 00:21:22,215
Yeah, 'cause we didn't need her anymore.

606
00:21:23,018 --> 00:21:24,218
We were just on our way

607
00:21:24,285 --> 00:21:25,986
to our first audition.

608
00:21:26,054 --> 00:21:27,121
Ooh, isn't that a thrill?

609
00:21:27,188 --> 00:21:28,422
You didn't think to ask me about that?

610
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,491
What do you mean, "our" audition?

611
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:32,159
I am up for a new role,

612
00:21:32,227 --> 00:21:33,427
and I thought it would be good

613
00:21:33,495 --> 00:21:34,995
to play off of somebody.

614
00:21:35,063 --> 00:21:36,196
Oh, okay.

615
00:21:36,264 --> 00:21:38,399
Can I talk to you for a sec?

616
00:21:38,466 --> 00:21:39,786
So you thought it'd be a good idea

617
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:41,668
to use Trixie as a prop?

618
00:21:41,736 --> 00:21:42,736
A co-star.

619
00:21:42,804 --> 00:21:44,271
Everyone's gotta start somewhere.

620
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:47,007
And isn't she the cutest
little lounge singer you've ever seen?

621
00:21:47,075 --> 00:21:48,442
She looks ridiculous.

622
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,878
How can you exploit your
family for your next acting job?

623
00:21:50,945 --> 00:21:52,465
You know, for someone who hated acting,

624
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,148
you sure know how to be dramatic.

625
00:21:54,215 --> 00:21:55,182
You can't do this.

626
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,550
You can't push Trixie into this

627
00:21:56,618 --> 00:21:58,152
the way that you pushed me.

628
00:21:58,219 --> 00:21:59,853
You can't walk in here...

629
00:21:59,921 --> 00:22:01,688
Like I own the place?

630
00:22:01,756 --> 00:22:03,057
The place you're living in

631
00:22:03,124 --> 00:22:05,292
rent free?

632
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,593
You asked me to stay here.

633
00:22:06,661 --> 00:22:08,962
You have no right to take her...

634
00:22:10,465 --> 00:22:12,433
Where is she?

635
00:22:13,334 --> 00:22:14,301
She was just here.

636
00:22:14,369 --> 00:22:15,669
Trixie?

637
00:22:16,771 --> 00:22:17,771
Trix?

638
00:22:19,174 --> 00:22:21,308
Trixie?

639
00:22:21,376 --> 00:22:22,910
Trixie!

640
00:22:22,977 --> 00:22:25,533
She's gone.

641
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:33,057
I've called her friends,
I've called our neighbors.

642
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:34,959
No one has heard from her. No.

643
00:22:35,027 --> 00:22:38,863
All right, I'll call
you if I hear anything.

644
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,464
Dan hasn't heard from her.

645
00:22:40,532 --> 00:22:41,666
Take a breath, Chloe.

646
00:22:41,733 --> 00:22:43,467
She's a smart
girl... where would she go?

647
00:22:43,535 --> 00:22:44,969
I don't know.

648
00:22:45,037 --> 00:22:47,171
- She left and...
- (phone chimes)

649
00:22:48,874 --> 00:22:49,840
What?

650
00:22:49,908 --> 00:22:51,275
What is it?

651
00:22:51,343 --> 00:22:54,979
She ordered a ride from my Uber account.

652
00:22:55,047 --> 00:22:56,781
Where'd she go?

653
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,384
 

654
00:23:12,464 --> 00:23:15,733
 Caught like a
deer in the headlights... 

655
00:23:15,801 --> 00:23:18,369
Is Lucifer here?

656
00:23:18,437 --> 00:23:20,838
 Don't know where to go 

657
00:23:20,906 --> 00:23:24,375
 Everybody sees right
through me... 

658
00:23:24,443 --> 00:23:26,277
Who are you supposed to be?

659
00:23:26,344 --> 00:23:28,546
I'm Trixie, his friend.

660
00:23:28,613 --> 00:23:31,482
His friends get worse and worse.

661
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:34,318
Hate to break it to
you, but he's not here.

662
00:23:34,386 --> 00:23:35,953
That's okay.

663
00:23:36,021 --> 00:23:38,022
I'll wait.

664
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:40,458
 Don't you understand 

665
00:23:40,525 --> 00:23:44,929
 All I ever wanted was
to be part of your plan 

666
00:23:44,996 --> 00:23:47,965
 People, oh, people, I
thought you all should know 

667
00:23:48,033 --> 00:23:50,134
 Swallowed all your medicine

668
00:23:50,202 --> 00:23:54,405
 Your Zoloft and your blow...

669
00:23:54,473 --> 00:23:57,875
So, what do you want with Lucifer?

670
00:23:57,943 --> 00:23:59,443
He cheers me up.

671
00:23:59,511 --> 00:24:01,846
I hate it when people fight over me.

672
00:24:01,913 --> 00:24:03,814
What people?

673
00:24:03,882 --> 00:24:06,283
My mom and dad used to a lot.

674
00:24:06,351 --> 00:24:07,651
But this time it was Mom

675
00:24:07,719 --> 00:24:09,954
fighting with Nana about how I look.

676
00:24:10,021 --> 00:24:14,091
Which one wants you to
look like an old drag queen?

677
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,727
My grandma, I guess.

678
00:24:16,795 --> 00:24:20,197
They're fighting over what
they want me to be when I grow up.

679
00:24:20,265 --> 00:24:21,632
What do you want to be?

680
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,902
I want to be the first
president of Mars.

681
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,771
Or a zookeeper.

682
00:24:26,838 --> 00:24:28,873
Mm-hmm.

683
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,642
I used to be a zookeeper.

684
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:33,310
In a way.

685
00:24:33,378 --> 00:24:36,313
Really? That's so cool.

686
00:24:36,381 --> 00:24:37,882
 I thought you should know... 

687
00:24:37,949 --> 00:24:39,683
Is this a Shirley Temple?

688
00:24:39,751 --> 00:24:42,553
 Don't you
understand all I ever wanted... 

689
00:24:42,621 --> 00:24:44,321
Sure.

690
00:24:44,389 --> 00:24:46,190
 People, oh, people... 

691
00:24:46,258 --> 00:24:47,358
CHLOE: Trixie!

692
00:24:47,425 --> 00:24:48,859
Thank God you're okay.

693
00:24:48,927 --> 00:24:50,394
What were you
thinking, running away like that?

694
00:24:50,462 --> 00:24:52,062
I wanted to see Lucifer.

695
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,964
But he wasn't here.

696
00:24:54,032 --> 00:24:56,367
So I made a new friend.

697
00:24:58,436 --> 00:24:59,904
What's your name?

698
00:24:59,971 --> 00:25:01,338
Mazikeen.

699
00:25:01,406 --> 00:25:03,908
But you can call me Maze.

700
00:25:04,976 --> 00:25:06,777
(sighs) Thank you, Maze.

701
00:25:06,845 --> 00:25:09,446
I didn't say you could.

702
00:25:09,514 --> 00:25:12,149
Right.

703
00:25:12,217 --> 00:25:13,651
 All I ever wanted was 

704
00:25:13,718 --> 00:25:16,787
 To be part of your
plan, oh, oh, oh, oh. 

705
00:25:19,257 --> 00:25:20,658
LUCIFER: How does it feel?

706
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,694
You know, to finally be free.

707
00:25:23,762 --> 00:25:25,796
I mean, you're about to be arrested.

708
00:25:25,864 --> 00:25:28,399
But, uh, at least you're free of him.

709
00:25:28,466 --> 00:25:29,667
What are you talking about?

710
00:25:29,734 --> 00:25:30,701
Your father!

711
00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:32,469
You killed him. Tell me all about it.

712
00:25:32,537 --> 00:25:34,605
I mean, is the air a little sweeter?

713
00:25:34,673 --> 00:25:37,007
Is the sun a little brighter?

714
00:25:37,075 --> 00:25:38,475
I didn't kill my dad, man.

715
00:25:38,543 --> 00:25:40,211
Oh, come on... why return to dispose

716
00:25:40,278 --> 00:25:41,946
of the murder weapon then?

717
00:25:42,013 --> 00:25:42,980
The heroin.

718
00:25:43,048 --> 00:25:44,215
Sorry, it's all gone.

719
00:25:44,282 --> 00:25:45,416
Police took it away for testing.

720
00:25:45,483 --> 00:25:47,718
Well, (chuckles) most of it.

721
00:25:47,786 --> 00:25:48,586
"Heroin"?

722
00:25:48,653 --> 00:25:49,753
No, I

723
00:25:49,821 --> 00:25:51,021
came for this.

724
00:25:51,089 --> 00:25:52,556
Ah-ah-ah-ah

725
00:25:52,624 --> 00:25:55,693
Careful, Junior, you
don't who you're playing with.

726
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,660
What?

727
00:25:56,728 --> 00:25:57,862
No.

728
00:25:57,929 --> 00:26:00,064
(sighs)

729
00:26:00,131 --> 00:26:02,433
My dad gave me this knife.

730
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,501
It's all I have left from him.

731
00:26:06,471 --> 00:26:08,672
You're not relieved he's gone at all.

732
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,574
Why would I be relieved?

733
00:26:10,642 --> 00:26:12,082
Because he was judgmental and cruel,

734
00:26:12,143 --> 00:26:14,245
and he tried to force you into
being someone you're not.

735
00:26:14,312 --> 00:26:16,013
And he's gone now.

736
00:26:16,081 --> 00:26:17,982
So you can finally be your own man.

737
00:26:18,049 --> 00:26:19,583
Oh, dear.

738
00:26:19,651 --> 00:26:21,785
You didn't kill him, did you?

739
00:26:21,853 --> 00:26:23,787
Of course not.

740
00:26:23,855 --> 00:26:25,723
(sighs)

741
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:28,525
So, are you gonna arrest me or what?

742
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:36,133
Hi, Trixie!

743
00:26:36,201 --> 00:26:38,202
I'm so glad you're back.

744
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,910
Listen, Nana needs to
explain something...

745
00:26:39,971 --> 00:26:42,172
- Mom, let's just have dinner, okay?
- (knocks)

746
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,074
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Dan!

747
00:26:44,142 --> 00:26:46,243
What a pleasant surprise.

748
00:26:46,311 --> 00:26:49,013
- And you brought dessert.
- Of course.

749
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,315
So thoughtful as always.

750
00:26:51,383 --> 00:26:52,917
So good to see you, Penny.

751
00:26:52,984 --> 00:26:54,218
Something smells amazing.

752
00:26:54,286 --> 00:26:55,653
- Mmm.
- Yeah, Mom.

753
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,421
Where'd you buy this
nice home-cooked meal?

754
00:26:57,489 --> 00:26:59,523
Oh, there's no take-out tonight.

755
00:26:59,591 --> 00:27:00,824
Lucifer

756
00:27:00,892 --> 00:27:02,626
has provided the meal.

757
00:27:02,694 --> 00:27:03,928
Wait.

758
00:27:03,995 --> 00:27:05,296
Lucifer's here?

759
00:27:05,363 --> 00:27:07,398
He and his friend have
been here a while.

760
00:27:07,465 --> 00:27:08,465
- His friend?
- LUCIFER: Ah!

761
00:27:08,533 --> 00:27:10,935
Detective! Just in time.

762
00:27:11,002 --> 00:27:12,670
Uh, you remember Junior?

763
00:27:12,737 --> 00:27:13,604
Of course.

764
00:27:13,672 --> 00:27:16,206
Just wait until you taste his molé.

765
00:27:16,274 --> 00:27:18,409
It is to die for.

766
00:27:24,781 --> 00:27:26,379
- Lucifer!
- LUCIFER: Oh, get back!

767
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,780
Okay, monkey, surprise.

768
00:27:28,848 --> 00:27:30,415
You get to eat
chocolate cake in bed tonight.

769
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:32,017
Why?

770
00:27:32,085 --> 00:27:33,251
Does it matter?

771
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:35,253
Nope.

772
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:37,155
Junior, if you wouldn't mind.

773
00:27:37,223 --> 00:27:39,624
(clears throat)

774
00:27:39,692 --> 00:27:41,626
- Yes?
- So you brought

775
00:27:41,694 --> 00:27:44,596
a guy who's suspected
of murder by poisoning

776
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:47,232
to cook for my family?

777
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,400
Well, if you arrest him,

778
00:27:48,468 --> 00:27:49,768
he's just going to lawyer up, isn't he?

779
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:51,770
So why not have a nice meal

780
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:53,271
whilst you get all the
answers you need, hmm?

781
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:54,806
I'm certain he'll open up.

782
00:27:54,874 --> 00:27:56,007
Why is that?

783
00:27:56,075 --> 00:27:57,242
Because I convinced
him you'd hear him out.

784
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,543
After all, he's innocent.

785
00:27:58,611 --> 00:27:59,911
Oh, you think he's innocent now?

786
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:01,079
Come on, Detective.

787
00:28:01,147 --> 00:28:02,781
If you're not
satisfied with his answers,

788
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:04,149
you can always arrest him afterwards.

789
00:28:04,217 --> 00:28:05,337
JUNIOR: I stopped eating meat

790
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:08,220
while backpacking through India,

791
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:11,590
so I had to get creative with my dishes.

792
00:28:11,657 --> 00:28:14,392
This is my vegetarian take

793
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,295
on Oaxacan molé with a tart,

794
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:18,663
vegan crème fraîche.

795
00:28:18,731 --> 00:28:21,199
- Sounds so exotic.
- Lovely.

796
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:22,434
I cannot wait to dig in.

797
00:28:22,502 --> 00:28:24,870
- Mom, don't eat that!
- Why not?

798
00:28:24,937 --> 00:28:26,337
She's worried it might be poisoned.

799
00:28:26,339 --> 00:28:28,140
- You are?
- Oh, that's right.

800
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:30,408
Let's catch you up,
shall we? Um, I brought

801
00:28:30,476 --> 00:28:31,610
Junior here tonight

802
00:28:31,677 --> 00:28:32,711
because Detective Decker believes

803
00:28:32,778 --> 00:28:33,745
that he killed his father.

804
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:35,647
- You do?
- What are you doing, man?

805
00:28:35,715 --> 00:28:37,835
But I believe he was after
something far more foolish.

806
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:38,717
Reconciliation.

807
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,385
JUNIOR: That's right.

808
00:28:40,453 --> 00:28:41,820
I didn't kill my dad.

809
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:42,821
Do you have proof?

810
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:45,557
Just my word.

811
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:47,385
Well, we might need something
more than that.

812
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:48,827
Oh, come on,
Detective, you said yourself

813
00:28:48,895 --> 00:28:50,795
you may want to kill your mother,
but you don't do it.

814
00:28:50,863 --> 00:28:52,864
Oh, so you want to kill me
now? Just because I put makeup

815
00:28:52,932 --> 00:28:54,559
- on your daughter?
- No, because she thinks

816
00:28:54,584 --> 00:28:56,091
thinks you're a child and forced her

817
00:28:56,135 --> 00:28:58,003
to grow up too quickly.

818
00:28:59,138 --> 00:29:00,438
Am I wrong?

819
00:29:00,506 --> 00:29:01,806
You're way out line, man.

820
00:29:01,874 --> 00:29:04,476
There he goes
leaping to her defense again.

821
00:29:04,544 --> 00:29:05,677
You know, perhaps you two are closer

822
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:07,179
to getting back together than I thought.

823
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:08,646
- You are?
- No, we haven't decided.

824
00:29:08,681 --> 00:29:10,148
Things are moving that way.

825
00:29:10,216 --> 00:29:12,117
We just had the one kiss.

826
00:29:12,185 --> 00:29:13,065
So you're kissing now?

827
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:14,386
Right.

828
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:16,453
Maybe that explains why
you won't have sex with me.

829
00:29:16,489 --> 00:29:17,689
I'm sorry, what?

830
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:19,024
No.

831
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,292
You're juggling

832
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:22,694
both these handsome gentlemen?

833
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:25,630
I'm not juggling anything.

834
00:29:25,698 --> 00:29:26,932
Well, trust me, honey,

835
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:28,166
you better do mething,

836
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:29,501
'cause you're not getting any younger.

837
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:31,529
However, what do I know?
Because I'm just a child.

838
00:29:31,571 --> 00:29:34,072
If you don't like it, why
don't you stop acting like one?

839
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,309
(laughing)

840
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:40,545
You guys sound just like me and my dad.

841
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:44,916
We used to fight all the
time over the dumbest stuff.

842
00:29:44,984 --> 00:29:46,885
That's why I left.

843
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:50,655
But no matter what I
did, I couldn't get away.

844
00:29:50,723 --> 00:29:52,857
You know, 'cause every time

845
00:29:52,925 --> 00:29:55,493
I cooked a meal or I
looked in the mirror,

846
00:29:55,561 --> 00:29:59,297
there he was staring back at me.

847
00:29:59,365 --> 00:30:00,565
That's a tad bit creepy.

848
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:03,435
Because he's a part of me, man.

849
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:05,270
You know, he may have pushed too hard,

850
00:30:05,338 --> 00:30:07,906
and-and-and tried to make
me something that I'm not,

851
00:30:07,974 --> 00:30:12,577
but in the end, it made me the man I am.

852
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:14,913
And I'm proud of who I've become.

853
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:16,982
Yeah, I came back home

854
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:20,285
so I could tell him that I was clean.

855
00:30:20,353 --> 00:30:22,787
And I want to be a chef again.

856
00:30:22,855 --> 00:30:24,489
And this meal?

857
00:30:24,557 --> 00:30:27,058
Was what I was gonna
make for him to prove it.

858
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:28,893
Well, it looks

859
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:31,630
very good.

860
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,834
I didn't kill my dad.

861
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:39,838
All right, so either arrest
me or let me go.

862
00:30:41,474 --> 00:30:43,475
Well, we are gonna need
you to come downtown,

863
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:44,509
and make a statement.

864
00:30:44,577 --> 00:30:46,144
DAN: Please.

865
00:30:46,212 --> 00:30:48,713
Let me... I'm happy to
have an excuse to leave.

866
00:30:48,781 --> 00:30:49,848
Dan...

867
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:51,716
Don't go.

868
00:30:52,952 --> 00:30:55,854
I wanted one reason to stick up for you.

869
00:30:56,889 --> 00:30:59,758
Just one. Let's go, pal.

870
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:04,663
Well...

871
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:07,265
I have suddenly lost my appetite.

872
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:09,100
(sighs)

873
00:31:09,168 --> 00:31:11,536
Absolutely.

874
00:31:11,604 --> 00:31:13,171
I hope you're happy.

875
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:16,174
No, actually, I'm
extremely disappointed.

876
00:31:16,242 --> 00:31:17,562
- Because you ruined dinner?
- No.

877
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:20,412
Because Junior's answer was
spectacularly unhelpful.

878
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:21,546
He didn't escape

879
00:31:21,614 --> 00:31:23,094
his father because he turned into him.

880
00:31:23,115 --> 00:31:25,717
I mean, that doesn't apply to me at all!

881
00:31:32,992 --> 00:31:34,526
(sighs)

882
00:31:40,866 --> 00:31:41,766
(clears throat)

883
00:31:41,834 --> 00:31:43,068
So I cleaned up.

884
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:44,736
The food, I mean.

885
00:31:44,804 --> 00:31:46,538
It wasn't quite the
same as Chef Javier's.

886
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:49,240
But I have to admit,
the boy can cook, so...

887
00:31:49,308 --> 00:31:52,877
I see you're still working the case.

888
00:31:52,945 --> 00:31:54,379
You were right.

889
00:31:54,447 --> 00:31:55,847
Junior's innocent.

890
00:31:55,915 --> 00:31:58,483
Well, glad you
learned something at dinner.

891
00:31:58,551 --> 00:31:59,551
No, the lab called.

892
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:01,119
The heroin that we found at Naomi's

893
00:32:01,187 --> 00:32:03,355
doesn't match the
kind that killed Javier.

894
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:05,023
So if Junior didn't kill his dad,

895
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:07,459
why use heroin?

896
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:09,828
To frame him, maybe?

897
00:32:09,895 --> 00:32:10,695
Yeah.

898
00:32:10,763 --> 00:32:11,996
I thought about that, too.

899
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:14,232
But the only person with
motive got poisoned herself.

900
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,468
Unless she knew exactly
how much to give herself.

901
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:19,137
Creating all the gruesome symptoms,

902
00:32:19,205 --> 00:32:22,240
but without the finale, yeah...

903
00:32:22,308 --> 00:32:24,609
But the restaurant was hers,

904
00:32:24,677 --> 00:32:26,611
so why would she do it?

905
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:29,981
I don't know, maybe
Pops had a change of heart.

906
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:32,083
Decided to bring
Junior back into the fold

907
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:34,886
after he found out he'd
changed and was coming home?

908
00:32:42,695 --> 00:32:43,935
Yeah, this is Detective Decker.

909
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:46,865
I'm calling about a
patient, Anne Martin.

910
00:32:46,932 --> 00:32:47,966
Yeah.

911
00:32:49,335 --> 00:32:51,002
An hour ago?

912
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:53,004
Yeah, thanks.

913
00:32:55,007 --> 00:32:56,941
Guess who checked out against orders.

914
00:32:57,009 --> 00:33:00,145
Well, I wonder where
our lovely sous-chef's

915
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:01,880
headed in such a hurry.

916
00:33:01,947 --> 00:33:03,915
(chuckles)

917
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:13,258
LUCIFER: Bravo.

918
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:14,565
That's a brilliant hiding place.

919
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:16,294
No wonder the police couldn't
find it earlier.

920
00:33:16,362 --> 00:33:17,629
What are you doing here?

921
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:18,963
Well, we'd ask you the same question,

922
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:20,365
but we already know you're
destroying evidence.

923
00:33:20,433 --> 00:33:21,766
Because you killed Javier.

924
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:24,369
I told you, I would never
do anything to hurt Javier.

925
00:33:24,437 --> 00:33:26,638
You seem genuinely upset.

926
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:28,640
Like you didn't want Javier to die.

927
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:31,176
You humans are quite the
paradox, aren't you?

928
00:33:31,243 --> 00:33:32,977
You're always
killing your loved ones and...

929
00:33:33,045 --> 00:33:35,046
Unless the poison wasn't meant for him.

930
00:33:35,114 --> 00:33:37,916
You meant to kill Junior, didn't you?

931
00:33:37,983 --> 00:33:39,184
What?

932
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:40,452
Oh.

933
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,120
Hence the drugs.

934
00:33:42,188 --> 00:33:43,755
He'd die a grisly death,

935
00:33:43,823 --> 00:33:45,957
and we'd assume he simply got a bad fix.

936
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:47,425
Oh, that is very clever.

937
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:48,526
Except you didn't realize

938
00:33:48,594 --> 00:33:49,494
that Junior changed while he was away.

939
00:33:49,562 --> 00:33:50,662
He stopped eating meat.

940
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:53,231
LUCIFER: Which is why his
father ate his food,

941
00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:55,200
and you killed the man you love.

942
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:57,635
Ooh, a cruel twist of fate.

943
00:33:57,703 --> 00:33:59,437
You don't know what
you're talking about.

944
00:33:59,505 --> 00:34:00,672
So when we test
that powder in your hand,

945
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:01,673
you're telling me it's not gonna match

946
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,941
the poison that killed Javier?

947
00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:06,377
That ungrateful kid did
not deserve this place.

948
00:34:06,445 --> 00:34:09,414
He was given everything,
and he threw it all away.

949
00:34:09,482 --> 00:34:12,217
But it didn't matter.

950
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:14,953
'Cause he was still the favorite.

951
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,956
Because he was
worthy of his father's love.

952
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:20,525
And he had a chance at redemption
until you ruined it.

953
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:33,137
Are you okay?

954
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:35,673
This place can't possibly be up to code.

955
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,042
We've got to get out of here.

956
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:39,910
Damn it, there's nowhere to go.

957
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:44,948
Oh, no, no, no, no, this
is not how it goes down,

958
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,051
not by a long shot, Dad.

959
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:49,286
Lucifer, if you have any ideas...

960
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:52,022
now's the time.

961
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,831
CHLOE: You can put me down.

962
00:35:00,899 --> 00:35:02,266
LUCIFER: Right.

963
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:03,667
Happy now?

964
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:10,207
(Lucifer scoffs)

965
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,209
The Devil gets burned by fire.

966
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:13,977
Could this be any more ironic?

967
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:15,746
- (chuckles)
- Ah.

968
00:35:15,814 --> 00:35:17,848
Does my pain amuse you, Detective?

969
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:19,383
A little bit.

970
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:20,984
And so does this.

971
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:23,987
(laughs)

972
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:25,989
You little rascal.

973
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:29,493
(indistinct radio transmission)

974
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:34,431
LUCIFER: Nice and tight.

975
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:36,366
Ah. Oh, thank you.

976
00:35:38,036 --> 00:35:40,237
Anne was arrested a few blocks away,

977
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:43,741
so she'll be eating prison
slop for a long time to come.

978
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,943
Ah, her own personal hell indeed.

979
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:52,616
Thank you. For getting me out.

980
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:54,852
Well, couldn't exactly
rush out of there alone.

981
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,320
How would that look? (chuckles)

982
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:58,822
That's it?

983
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:02,192
No "thanks for saving me first"?

984
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,629
Is that what happened?

985
00:36:05,697 --> 00:36:07,598
It's funny, it's all so fuzzy now.

986
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,800
Must be the third-degree burns.

987
00:36:09,868 --> 00:36:11,535
(chuckles)

988
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:14,872
Can't believe it's gone.

989
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:18,509
We found out what your
dad never got to tell you.

990
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:22,412
He was gonna leave you the
restaurant all along.

991
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:24,515
If you even want it.

992
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:27,785
I think I do.

993
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,988
And maybe I could rebuild it.

994
00:36:31,055 --> 00:36:32,556
You know, make it my own.

995
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:36,493
(knocking at door)

996
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:38,796
Uh, hang on, just a second.

997
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,197
Maze.

998
00:36:40,265 --> 00:36:43,433
I'm surprised you came back.

999
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:44,434
I made a friend today.

1000
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:47,171
That's fantastic news.

1001
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:48,438
Who?

1002
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:51,108
An eight-year-old girl who
wandered into the bar.

1003
00:36:51,176 --> 00:36:53,844
Well...

1004
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:55,913
That's a start.

1005
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,182
Perhaps the next one can
be of legal drinking age.

1006
00:36:58,249 --> 00:37:01,885
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.

1007
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:03,487
Yeah.

1008
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:06,590
So are you... busy tonight?

1009
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:11,328
 Now I don't even know 

1010
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:14,431
 Oh, I don't even know... 

1011
00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:16,500
What happened to you?

1012
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:19,036
Oh, it's, uh...

1013
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:21,939
it's been kind of a rough night.

1014
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:24,708
So I could use a drink.

1015
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:25,976
Here.

1016
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:37,254
What are you... what are you doing up?

1017
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:39,489
I have an early flight.

1018
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:41,992
And I didn't want to
leave without saying good-bye.

1019
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:45,295
But you just got home.

1020
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:48,332
Look, I know

1021
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:51,335
I haven't always been the easiest mom.

1022
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:54,805
I could be pushy.

1023
00:37:54,873 --> 00:37:56,940
Overbearing.

1024
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:58,609
I am sorry

1025
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:01,845
that you felt that you always
had to be the adult.

1026
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:07,050
All I ever wanted
was for you to be happy.

1027
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,919
I know.

1028
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:13,957
And sometimes I think you
could just take a leap.

1029
00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:16,860
Hmm.

1030
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:19,396
(chuckles)

1031
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:20,964
Good night, pumpkin.

1032
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:22,633
Good night.

1033
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,135
 Yeah, we can go slow 

1034
00:38:25,203 --> 00:38:28,138
 I'm on my own again... 

1035
00:38:28,206 --> 00:38:30,307
 I'm on my own again 

1036
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:33,644
 Whoa 

1037
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:45,756
What's up, partner?

1038
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,891
It's awfully late to
be calling a meet, huh?

1039
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:50,427
You were right.

1040
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:53,430
Lucifer Morningstar is
insane and dangerous.

1041
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,332
And he deserves everything he gets.

1042
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,334
Well, that works out perfectly.

1043
00:38:57,402 --> 00:38:59,336
(chuckles)

1044
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,876
But I can't let you kill him.

1045
00:39:08,246 --> 00:39:10,047
Come on, man.

1046
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:12,182
I mean, we talked about this.

1047
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,919
You know, I go down, you go down.

1048
00:39:15,987 --> 00:39:17,387
Then I go down.

1049
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:19,289
It's too bad.

1050
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:21,858
(handcuffs clicking) I mean,

1051
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:25,028
I thought we had
something really special going.

1052
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,767
Go to hell. Come on.

1053
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,769
(chuckles)

1054
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:39,943
(grunting)

1055
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,039
(laughing)

1056
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:10,040
Go to sleep.

1057
00:40:10,108 --> 00:40:11,041
There you go.

1058
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,579
(phone chimes)

1059
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:33,430
Don't worry.

1060
00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:35,899
I'll answer for you.

1061
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:41,905
 Love will find a way 

1062
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:44,174
 I won't let 

1063
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:46,576
-  This thunderhearts ever break 
- (elevator bell dings)

1064
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:47,711
 I won't be the same... 

1065
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:48,512
Detective?

1066
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:51,381
This is unexpected.

1067
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,917
You said the door's always open,

1068
00:40:53,985 --> 00:40:56,253
and I'm walking through it.

1069
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,721
Mmm.

1070
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:00,157
Right, well, I was just on my
way out to meet the Brittanys,

1071
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:03,827
but... I suppose
they can occupy each other.

1072
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:06,129
Great.

1073
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:07,531
Then have a seat.

1074
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:09,332
Yes. Has something happened...

1075
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,736
I'm guessing by the
looks of it... with Dan perhaps?

1076
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:13,503
Mmm.

1077
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:15,272
You mean Detective Douche?

1078
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:18,083
(laughs) Yes, well, of
course that's what I mean,

1079
00:41:18,197 --> 00:41:19,953
but the bigger question
here is: why do you mean that?

1080
00:41:19,954 --> 00:41:21,645
We weren't even back together,

1081
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:24,114
and he ended it with me tonight.

1082
00:41:24,182 --> 00:41:25,649
With a text.

1083
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:27,717
I mean, what, are we in high school?

1084
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:30,454
Well, we're
certainly drinking like we are.

1085
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:33,223
Why don't you have a seat over here

1086
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:35,325
and tell me all about it, hmm?

1087
00:41:35,393 --> 00:41:37,160
I just feel like an idiot.

1088
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:40,797
I can't believe that I would
let myself care for him again.

1089
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:42,332
I mean, why?

1090
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,667
So I get hurt?

1091
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:45,936
Um, no, because you're a kind person

1092
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:48,405
who puts the needs of
others before your own.

1093
00:41:48,473 --> 00:41:51,608
It's a horrible irony that
my father invented.

1094
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:53,343
But you don't do that.

1095
00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:55,145
You just take what you want.

1096
00:41:55,213 --> 00:41:57,881
Since the beginning of time.

1097
00:41:57,949 --> 00:41:59,416
That's nice.

1098
00:41:59,484 --> 00:42:01,618
(both chuckle)

1099
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:06,556
Uh...

1100
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:11,294
What's happening?

1101
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:14,898
It would seem that I'm saying no.

1102
00:42:14,966 --> 00:42:18,368
But you've been trying to get
me into bed since day one.

1103
00:42:18,436 --> 00:42:19,903
Why are you saying no?

1104
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:21,931
Well, frankly, my dear, I'm
as baffled as you are.

1105
00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:23,507
I mean, usually I'd leap at the chance

1106
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:25,375
to fulfill my carnal desire, but...

1107
00:42:25,443 --> 00:42:29,980
(sighs) for some reason, I can't.

1108
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,448
What am I doing?

1109
00:42:31,516 --> 00:42:33,450
Why am I here, drunk,
throwing myself at you?

1110
00:42:33,518 --> 00:42:35,185
This is so sad.

1111
00:42:35,253 --> 00:42:36,953
Well, it happens to the best, I promise.

1112
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:38,955
But not to me.

1113
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:41,958
I don't do this.

1114
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:45,962
This is something...

1115
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,931
my mom would do.

1116
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:50,333
(chuckles) That's who'd do it.

1117
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:54,337
Come here.

1118
00:42:57,008 --> 00:43:00,410
We don't all turn into
our parents, Detective.

1119
00:43:00,478 --> 00:43:02,212
(laughing) I mean, look at me.

1120
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,415
I don't think I've ever been the
son that He wants me to be.

1121
00:43:05,483 --> 00:43:08,351
- I, uh...
- (snoring)

1122
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:18,061
Oh, God.

1123
00:43:18,129 --> 00:43:23,769
 Amen...

Amenadiel is right...

3
00:00:07,249 --> 00:00:08,384
you are changing.

4
00:00:08,524 --> 00:00:10,225
You betrayed me, Maze.

5
00:00:10,293 --> 00:00:12,560
- Lucifer...
- I don't want to hear it. We're done.

6
00:00:12,628 --> 00:00:14,267
Enjoying the life I gave you?

7
00:00:14,342 --> 00:00:16,564
Do you want to go back?

8
00:00:16,632 --> 00:00:19,100
Because I can make that happen.

9
00:00:19,168 --> 00:00:22,237
Seems I'm dealing
with a bit of a mortality sitch.

10
00:00:22,305 --> 00:00:23,405
I'm bleeding.

11
00:00:23,472 --> 00:00:25,941
All I have to do is
wait for some pitiful thug

12
00:00:26,008 --> 00:00:29,611
to end you, and
right back to Hell you go.

13
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,079
Who do you want me to kill?

14
00:00:31,147 --> 00:00:34,215
Lucifer Morningstar deserves
everything he gets,

15
00:00:34,283 --> 00:00:35,784
but I can't let you kill him.

16
00:00:38,654 --> 00:00:42,023
It would seem that I'm saying no.

17
00:00:42,091 --> 00:00:43,325
Oh, God.

18
00:01:12,088 --> 00:01:14,289
Oh, no.

19
00:01:14,357 --> 00:01:17,492
No. No.

20
00:01:18,561 --> 00:01:20,128
Oh, God.

21
00:01:20,196 --> 00:01:22,297
Oh, God, what have I done?

22
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:26,568
Don't worry, my
father's the forgiving sort.

23
00:01:26,635 --> 00:01:28,470
Well, except when it comes to me.

24
00:01:28,537 --> 00:01:31,306
Triple espresso or hair of the dog?

25
00:01:31,374 --> 00:01:32,640
No.

26
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:33,908
Oh, right.

27
00:01:33,976 --> 00:01:35,276
Both.

28
00:01:37,747 --> 00:01:40,548
Please tell me, we didn't...

29
00:01:40,616 --> 00:01:42,450
Did we ever.

30
00:01:42,518 --> 00:01:45,553
And I'm pretty sure we
made Rosemary's baby.

31
00:01:45,621 --> 00:01:47,922
Oh, Detective, it was extraordinary.

32
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,991
The heat, the gymnastics.

33
00:01:50,059 --> 00:01:53,194
I mean, you had
moves that made even the Devil blush.

34
00:01:53,262 --> 00:01:55,263
Oh, no, this is bad.

35
00:01:55,331 --> 00:01:57,599
Whatever happened last night,

36
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:59,267
don't tell me, I'd rather not know.

37
00:01:59,335 --> 00:02:00,695
What, that we didn't do the nasty?

38
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:03,271
We didn't?

39
00:02:03,339 --> 00:02:05,073
Nope, I turned you down cold.

40
00:02:05,141 --> 00:02:07,642
You, the guy who's been
trying to get me into the sack

41
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,112
since day one had a
chance to sleep with me,

42
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,113
and you did...?

43
00:02:12,181 --> 00:02:13,415
Why-why am I naked?

44
00:02:13,482 --> 00:02:14,682
What, you mean you
don't remember the part

45
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,818
where you passed out, woke up again,

46
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:20,121
shouted at me, "It's too hot
in this five-story hellhole,"

47
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:21,523
I believe it was,

48
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,025
then tore your clothes off and
proceeded to hog the bed?

49
00:02:24,093 --> 00:02:25,427
I do that. Sometimes.

50
00:02:25,494 --> 00:02:27,028
When I'm upset.

51
00:02:27,096 --> 00:02:29,697
And you'd be upset, too, if
your ex dumped you by text.

52
00:02:29,765 --> 00:02:31,633
No, I'd be relieved if Dan dumped me.

53
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,068
Even still,

54
00:02:33,135 --> 00:02:35,170
it's very out of
character to see you so unhinged.

55
00:02:35,237 --> 00:02:37,439
And out of character for me, too.

56
00:02:37,506 --> 00:02:39,607
The whole "not wanting to
have sex with you" thing.

57
00:02:39,675 --> 00:02:41,342
I mean, here's the strange part.

58
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,812
This gave me quite a rush.

59
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:44,979
Can't explain it.

60
00:02:45,047 --> 00:02:46,948
I've been thinking about it all night.

61
00:02:47,016 --> 00:02:49,951
Okay, last night was a fluke.

62
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:51,319
For both of us.

63
00:02:51,387 --> 00:02:53,788
Never happened, leave it at that.

64
00:02:53,856 --> 00:02:54,756
Right.

65
00:02:56,992 --> 00:02:59,027
You snore, by the way.

66
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,562
Like an Albanian field wench!

67
00:03:07,903 --> 00:03:10,538
Did you finally seal the
deal with your little detective?

68
00:03:10,606 --> 00:03:14,275
If we were on speaking
terms, perhaps I'd fill you in.

69
00:03:14,343 --> 00:03:15,310
Where are you going?

70
00:03:15,377 --> 00:03:16,578
Why do you ask?

71
00:03:16,645 --> 00:03:18,780
You still reporting back to my brother?

72
00:03:18,848 --> 00:03:20,014
Lucifer...

73
00:03:20,082 --> 00:03:21,282
No, do me a favor, Maze.

74
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,284
How about you let me lead my life,

75
00:03:23,352 --> 00:03:25,553
and I'll let you lead yours, deal?

76
00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:27,789
You can't be mad at me forever.

77
00:03:28,824 --> 00:03:30,325
Oh, but I can.

78
00:03:30,392 --> 00:03:32,494
It's one of the
luxuries of being the Devil.

79
00:03:40,636 --> 00:03:43,304
Detective, I believe you left these

80
00:03:43,372 --> 00:03:45,039
after our sleepover last night.

81
00:03:45,107 --> 00:03:46,774
What's the hole at the back for?

82
00:03:46,842 --> 00:03:47,742
Not mine.

83
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,810
Those are not mine.

84
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:50,745
More of a commando girl.

85
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,013
Fair enough.

86
00:03:52,081 --> 00:03:53,281
Dearie me.

87
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:55,850
Someone woke up on
the wrong side of a .38.

88
00:03:55,918 --> 00:03:58,686
Yeah, single gunshot
wound to the chest.

89
00:03:58,754 --> 00:03:59,854
No wallet.

90
00:03:59,922 --> 00:04:02,557
Tan marks where a ring
and a watch were lifted.

91
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,292
A staircase robbery.

92
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,394
Is that a thing now?

93
00:04:06,462 --> 00:04:07,982
This is the Dunlear Foundation.

94
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:10,265
They help the homeless
and the underprivileged.

95
00:04:10,332 --> 00:04:12,534
So, who's the dashing corpse?

96
00:04:12,601 --> 00:04:15,537
Tim Dunlear himself, head
of the foundation,

97
00:04:15,604 --> 00:04:18,540
former NBA star, notorious playboy.

98
00:04:18,607 --> 00:04:21,009
He was into drugs, gambling, women.

99
00:04:21,076 --> 00:04:22,410
My typical Wednesday.

100
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:25,413
But then he left pro ball and
he turned his life around.

101
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:28,149
He dedicated himself to philanthropy.

102
00:04:28,217 --> 00:04:29,417
He was beloved.

103
00:04:29,485 --> 00:04:32,420
Right, bad boy turned good.

104
00:04:32,488 --> 00:04:34,022
It's interesting.

105
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:35,290
Are you Emmett Toussaint?

106
00:04:35,357 --> 00:04:36,691
You found the body?

107
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,526
I'm Detective Decker. Can
you tell us what happened?

108
00:04:38,594 --> 00:04:41,963
I volunteer for the foundation's
outreach program.

109
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,999
Came here to meet him, and
he was just lying here.

110
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:46,434
How did you know Mr. Dunlear?

111
00:04:46,502 --> 00:04:49,304
He sponsored me to come to
L.A. after the earthquake in Haiti.

112
00:04:49,371 --> 00:04:50,872
Tim was my mentor.

113
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,674
Handsome and saintly.

114
00:04:52,741 --> 00:04:54,181
Did you see anyone else at the scene

115
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,376
or notice anything strange?

116
00:04:55,444 --> 00:04:57,378
There was a guy outside.

117
00:04:57,446 --> 00:04:59,113
He ran when he saw me.

118
00:04:59,181 --> 00:05:00,782
I gave the cops a description.

119
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:02,150
Think he was homeless.

120
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:06,254
Did Mr. Dunlear ever speak of
a certain philanthropic high

121
00:05:06,322 --> 00:05:07,956
after one of his selfless acts?

122
00:05:08,023 --> 00:05:09,290
You know, for example,

123
00:05:09,358 --> 00:05:11,826
say when he chose not to
sleep with a drunken woman?

124
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:14,963
What?

125
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,030
Did I say something wrong?

126
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,933
We are questioning a minor.

127
00:05:20,202 --> 00:05:22,670
I'm sorry about your mentor.

128
00:05:22,738 --> 00:05:25,206
We'll call you if we have
any more questions.

129
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,044
What? I just feel quite connected

130
00:05:30,112 --> 00:05:31,846
to our victim.

131
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,282
You are nothing like Tim Dunlear.

132
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,150
Bad boy with a heart of gold?

133
00:05:36,218 --> 00:05:37,685
I am everything like Tim.

134
00:05:37,753 --> 00:05:39,354
May as well be solving my own murder.

135
00:05:39,421 --> 00:05:41,356
Only you could turn a tragic death

136
00:05:41,423 --> 00:05:43,825
into an excuse to talk about you.

137
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,629
Well, who else would I talk about?

138
00:05:49,898 --> 00:05:51,833
Got these on sale.

139
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,003
Extra strong, UV resistant,

140
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,372
and still 30% off.

141
00:06:00,374 --> 00:06:02,710
Do you really think
you're gonna get away with this?

142
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:04,646
Probably not.

143
00:06:04,713 --> 00:06:06,414
I'll bet the SWAT team's about

144
00:06:06,482 --> 00:06:09,417
to bust down the door any minute.

145
00:06:09,485 --> 00:06:10,685
Not like there's much else going on

146
00:06:10,753 --> 00:06:13,855
in a city of four million people.

147
00:06:13,922 --> 00:06:17,859
As much as I hate Lucifer, I'm
not gonna let you kill him.

148
00:06:17,926 --> 00:06:20,595
Oh, I'm not gonna do anything. No. Oh.

149
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:24,165
But you know who would want him dead?

150
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:26,301
Someone who's jealous.

151
00:06:26,368 --> 00:06:27,835
Someone who hates the fact

152
00:06:27,903 --> 00:06:30,905
that he's clearly got a
thing for his ex-wife.

153
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,809
Ooh.

154
00:06:34,877 --> 00:06:38,880
Someone whose fingerprints I
put all over the murder weapon.

155
00:06:38,947 --> 00:06:40,481
Sound like anyone you know, Dan?

156
00:06:41,483 --> 00:06:42,684
Ooh.

157
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,536
Don't go anywhere.

158
00:06:53,862 --> 00:06:55,222
My husband was so generous.

159
00:06:55,264 --> 00:06:57,699
If they had just asked for help,

160
00:06:57,766 --> 00:06:59,000
he would have given them anything.

161
00:06:59,068 --> 00:07:02,103
What kind of person
would do something like this?

162
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,638
Well, how much time do you have?

163
00:07:03,706 --> 00:07:06,841
Tim would be devastated to
know we've got to cancel

164
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:07,809
the fund-raising gala.

165
00:07:07,876 --> 00:07:09,077
You're right, Kyle.

166
00:07:09,144 --> 00:07:11,646
Well, we wouldn't want to
devastate our fallen hero.

167
00:07:11,714 --> 00:07:13,448
The show must go on.

168
00:07:13,515 --> 00:07:14,715
This is an active crime scene.

169
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,018
We can't have an event here.

170
00:07:17,086 --> 00:07:18,286
No, that wouldn't be right.

171
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,154
Well, I just happen to own

172
00:07:20,222 --> 00:07:21,689
the preeminent party
venue in Los Angeles.

173
00:07:21,757 --> 00:07:24,392
You can hold your benefit at my club.

174
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,827
- I don't know.
- No, no, your husband

175
00:07:25,894 --> 00:07:27,095
was a kindred spirit,

176
00:07:27,162 --> 00:07:29,364
and I pledge to carry on his good work

177
00:07:29,431 --> 00:07:33,101
and personally find...
and punish... his killer.

178
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:36,371
Tim always said "Tragedy brings sorrow

179
00:07:36,438 --> 00:07:37,972
but also true good."

180
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,973
Aw.

181
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,708
Thank you.

182
00:07:40,776 --> 00:07:42,210
You are so welcome.

183
00:07:46,081 --> 00:07:48,416
If this was a robbery, our
perp's gonna want to cash in

184
00:07:48,484 --> 00:07:50,418
before the cops get wind of this,

185
00:07:50,486 --> 00:07:52,186
so I'll call the local pawn shops...

186
00:07:52,254 --> 00:07:54,856
What is with you today?

187
00:07:54,923 --> 00:07:56,163
It was rather benevolent of me,

188
00:07:56,191 --> 00:07:57,925
offering up Lux, don't you think?

189
00:07:57,993 --> 00:07:59,360
Well, one good deed doesn't
make you a saint.

190
00:07:59,428 --> 00:08:01,829
Well, last I counted,
it was two good deeds.

191
00:08:01,897 --> 00:08:04,565
But, uh, I'm not
feeling the same rush as before.

192
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:06,367
Perhaps I'm gonna have to up my game.

193
00:08:06,435 --> 00:08:09,103
Whatever you say, St. Lucifer.

194
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:11,572
Oh, "St. Lucifer."

195
00:08:12,474 --> 00:08:14,575
Suits me, don't you think?

196
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:23,023
Synced and corrected by VitoSilans
- www.Addic7ed.com -

197
00:08:26,608 --> 00:08:29,501
It's funny, I've always
looked at do-gooders with pity.

198
00:08:29,502 --> 00:08:31,953
Little did I know their dirty secret.

199
00:08:32,021 --> 00:08:33,822
And what's that?

200
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,191
- Feels good to do good.
- Yes.

201
00:08:36,259 --> 00:08:39,895
Good deeds do bring an
amount of personal satisfaction

202
00:08:39,962 --> 00:08:41,196
to those who engage in them.

203
00:08:41,264 --> 00:08:44,733
No, but I mean it's
like a literal rush, a high.

204
00:08:44,801 --> 00:08:48,303
Have you ever mixed
cocaine and Molly with Pop Rocks?

205
00:08:48,371 --> 00:08:50,305
It's nothing like
that. I'm just curious.

206
00:08:50,373 --> 00:08:54,209
So you're feeling good about
not sleeping with Detective Decker.

207
00:08:54,277 --> 00:08:56,878
Well, yes, and offering
Lux to the Dunlear Foundation,

208
00:08:56,946 --> 00:08:59,247
not to mention
vowing to find Tim's killer.

209
00:08:59,315 --> 00:09:01,983
You've identified
quite strongly with this man.

210
00:09:02,051 --> 00:09:04,252
Yes. Yes, a man of honor, principle.

211
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,122
Hmm. You like the way being
good makes you feel.

212
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,423
- Mm.
- But true good needs

213
00:09:08,491 --> 00:09:12,461
to come from a place of
selflessness, authenticity.

214
00:09:12,528 --> 00:09:13,729
Well, of course.

215
00:09:13,796 --> 00:09:16,498
I authentically want
people to applaud the real me.

216
00:09:16,566 --> 00:09:18,033
The Devil gets a terrible rap.

217
00:09:18,101 --> 00:09:21,937
So you care about
image, how you look to others.

218
00:09:22,004 --> 00:09:23,438
And you're welcome.

219
00:09:23,506 --> 00:09:28,110
Okay, my point is, it's wonderful
that you're evolving.

220
00:09:28,177 --> 00:09:28,944
Right.

221
00:09:29,011 --> 00:09:31,613
But goodness isn't a toy.

222
00:09:31,681 --> 00:09:34,449
Well, the way I'm
going to play with it, it is.

223
00:09:40,423 --> 00:09:42,290
I'm in between gigs.

224
00:09:42,358 --> 00:09:45,627
I'm no thief, I'm an
actor, Louie DelGado.

225
00:09:45,695 --> 00:09:49,398
I had an arc on Party
of Five, look me up.

226
00:09:49,465 --> 00:09:52,167
I love L.A. Even the
homeless have an IMDb page.

227
00:09:52,235 --> 00:09:53,402
You care to explain why you were

228
00:09:53,469 --> 00:09:55,470
caught pawning Tim
Dunlear's championship ring?

229
00:09:55,538 --> 00:09:57,939
Listen, more importantly, why
did you take it to a pawnshop?

230
00:09:58,007 --> 00:09:59,741
The Dark Web has much better margins.

231
00:09:59,809 --> 00:10:01,062
I swear I didn't do nothing.

232
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,234
Witnesses put you at the scene.

233
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:04,146
You're telling me this
wasn't a robbery gone wrong?

234
00:10:04,213 --> 00:10:06,815
He was already dead, been
like that for a bit.

235
00:10:06,883 --> 00:10:08,617
Rigor mortis had set in.

236
00:10:08,684 --> 00:10:11,219
I also did a guest spot on CSI.

237
00:10:11,287 --> 00:10:12,087
Ah.

238
00:10:12,155 --> 00:10:14,089
Tim was my buddy,

239
00:10:14,157 --> 00:10:17,159
one of the few people who treated
me like a human being.

240
00:10:17,226 --> 00:10:19,127
Would your buddy have
approved of you stealing valuables

241
00:10:19,195 --> 00:10:21,163
from his cold dead corpse?

242
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,898
Tim didn't care about stuff.

243
00:10:22,965 --> 00:10:25,600
Would have wanted me to have that ring.

244
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:26,802
Give you the shirt off his back.

245
00:10:26,869 --> 00:10:27,803
What about his wallet?

246
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:31,072
Uh, I was gonna return that.

247
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:33,909
Some kind of key card.

248
00:10:33,976 --> 00:10:35,143
I have an alibi.

249
00:10:35,211 --> 00:10:36,311
I was at a shelter on 7th.

250
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:38,113
Uh-huh. Keep an eye on Louie.

251
00:10:38,181 --> 00:10:40,582
I'm gonna see if his story checks out.

252
00:10:45,121 --> 00:10:47,756
I also know what it's
like to be without a home.

253
00:10:47,824 --> 00:10:49,191
My father kicked me out.

254
00:10:49,258 --> 00:10:51,226
It's very traumatic.

255
00:10:51,294 --> 00:10:55,263
But, much like Tim Dunlear, I'd
like to do whatever it takes

256
00:10:55,331 --> 00:10:58,233
to help you, so,
here, the shirt off my back.

257
00:10:58,301 --> 00:11:00,602
Yeah.

258
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,137
And, uh, as you can see,

259
00:11:02,205 --> 00:11:04,773
the Devil does indeed wear Prada.

260
00:11:04,841 --> 00:11:07,008
Wow, thanks, brother.

261
00:11:07,076 --> 00:11:08,643
Yes, disastrous

262
00:11:08,711 --> 00:11:10,645
with those trousers, though.

263
00:11:10,713 --> 00:11:11,646
Oh, what the hell?

264
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:13,348
As gratitude for telling us

265
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:16,885
everything you know.

266
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:21,156
And he's naked.

267
00:11:21,224 --> 00:11:22,390
Another act

268
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:23,692
of selfless benevolence.

269
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:24,693
It's quite liberating, actually.

270
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,961
Oh, don't forget.

271
00:11:26,028 --> 00:11:27,429
Dry-clean only.

272
00:11:27,497 --> 00:11:28,563
His story checks out.

273
00:11:28,631 --> 00:11:29,698
We need to get a full written statement.

274
00:11:29,765 --> 00:11:31,199
And get our guy some lunch, okay?

275
00:11:31,267 --> 00:11:32,434
No-no gluten

276
00:11:32,502 --> 00:11:34,402
or-or dairy, okay?

277
00:11:35,905 --> 00:11:37,506
Another good deed

278
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:39,374
but still no rush like before.

279
00:11:39,442 --> 00:11:40,675
Am I doing this wrong?

280
00:11:40,743 --> 00:11:42,444
In so many ways.

281
00:11:42,512 --> 00:11:43,879
Oh?

282
00:11:43,946 --> 00:11:46,214
You're not getting in my car like that.

283
00:11:49,085 --> 00:11:50,986
Meet you at mine?

284
00:11:54,991 --> 00:11:58,059
So, who do we suspect
of this grisly murder?

285
00:11:58,127 --> 00:12:00,462
Maybe Mr. Dunlear wasn't
as saintly as he appeared.

286
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:03,765
Who knows who or
what he was involved with?

287
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,201
He wasn't always such a good man.

288
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:07,335
It's hard to shake your true nature.

289
00:12:07,403 --> 00:12:08,770
Well, not really. Look at me.

290
00:12:08,838 --> 00:12:10,472
Oh, no, I saw plenty.

291
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,907
- Thank you.
- Cheeky.

292
00:12:11,974 --> 00:12:14,543
Oh, Lucifer, Detective.

293
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:15,844
I wasn't expecting you.

294
00:12:15,912 --> 00:12:17,552
Yes, we have a few
more questions for you.

295
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,248
Yes, how are you holding up?

296
00:12:20,316 --> 00:12:21,783
Doing my best.

297
00:12:21,851 --> 00:12:22,691
One moment at a time.

298
00:12:22,752 --> 00:12:23,952
Mrs. Dunlear,

299
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,086
can you think of any personal reason

300
00:12:25,154 --> 00:12:26,955
why someone would
want to kill your husband?

301
00:12:27,023 --> 00:12:28,790
I thought this was a robbery.

302
00:12:28,858 --> 00:12:30,091
No, turns out

303
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,960
your husband was dead before
our homeless thespian

304
00:12:32,028 --> 00:12:33,929
pilfered his valuables.

305
00:12:33,996 --> 00:12:34,930
Did Tim have any enemies?

306
00:12:34,997 --> 00:12:36,598
Anyone that would want to hurt him?

307
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:37,632
No, absolutely not.

308
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,833
Everybody loved Tim.

309
00:12:38,901 --> 00:12:40,101
Will Fleming...

310
00:12:40,169 --> 00:12:42,404
counsel for the
foundation and the Dunlears.

311
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:43,672
This won't
take long, Mr. Fleming.

312
00:12:43,739 --> 00:12:45,240
Well, you're absolutely correct,

313
00:12:45,308 --> 00:12:46,575
because my client is done here.

314
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:47,709
- Wha...?
- Oh.

315
00:12:47,777 --> 00:12:48,810
Actually I'm

316
00:12:48,878 --> 00:12:50,845
just here to talk to Vanessa

317
00:12:50,913 --> 00:12:52,280
about the gala... is that, uh,

318
00:12:52,348 --> 00:12:53,868
is that all right? Are you up to that?

319
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,150
Yes, of course.

320
00:12:55,217 --> 00:12:56,251
Lovely.

321
00:12:58,087 --> 00:12:59,687
So I know it's not a good time, Vanessa.

322
00:12:59,722 --> 00:13:01,022
But I want to discuss...

323
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,791
My client is grieving.

324
00:13:02,858 --> 00:13:04,159
You have any questions, you talk to me.

325
00:13:04,226 --> 00:13:05,527
All right, can you establish

326
00:13:05,595 --> 00:13:07,929
Vanessa's whereabouts
at the time of Tim's death?

327
00:13:07,997 --> 00:13:09,437
Are you accusing my client of murder?

328
00:13:09,465 --> 00:13:12,634
No, but one quarter of murders
are committed by family members.

329
00:13:12,702 --> 00:13:14,703
Yes, and half by acquaintances.

330
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,171
Which gets to my next question.

331
00:13:16,238 --> 00:13:17,838
Where were you the night of Tim's death?

332
00:13:17,873 --> 00:13:19,473
Listen, you can look at me all you want.

333
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:22,577
But Tim came into contact with
a lot of people around this place.

334
00:13:22,645 --> 00:13:24,279
Desperate people.

335
00:13:24,347 --> 00:13:27,716
Why do I get the feeling you
have someone specific in mind?

336
00:13:27,783 --> 00:13:29,918
Did you ever fight with Tim?

337
00:13:32,588 --> 00:13:34,723
Last night.

338
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,891
You didn't tell me that earlier.

339
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,360
I was ashamed.

340
00:13:38,427 --> 00:13:40,261
Tim told me I might not be receiving

341
00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:42,864
the scholarship money he promised.

342
00:13:42,932 --> 00:13:44,399
I got angry.

343
00:13:46,435 --> 00:13:49,037
Said some things.

344
00:13:49,105 --> 00:13:51,806
I was going to go apologize, but...

345
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:54,175
when I got there...

346
00:13:54,243 --> 00:13:56,411
I'm gonna need to test
you for gunshot residue.

347
00:13:56,479 --> 00:13:58,613
And get a full written statement.

348
00:13:58,681 --> 00:14:01,049
Whatever you need.

349
00:14:02,918 --> 00:14:05,587
First, I want you to tell me more about

350
00:14:05,655 --> 00:14:06,855
Tim and his relationship

351
00:14:06,922 --> 00:14:09,057
with Vanessa... what was it like?

352
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,959
Great...

353
00:14:11,027 --> 00:14:12,727
when the cameras were on.

354
00:14:12,795 --> 00:14:14,929
And when they were off?

355
00:14:16,866 --> 00:14:18,867
Ah, Detective, you made it.

356
00:14:18,934 --> 00:14:20,802
A little underdressed, but okay.

357
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,737
What happened with the orphan child?

358
00:14:22,805 --> 00:14:24,673
We're holding him, waiting
on ballistics.

359
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,542
But he had a lot to say about
the Dunlears' perfect marriage.

360
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,145
Apparently Tim hadn't slept
at home in months.

361
00:14:30,212 --> 00:14:31,680
Well, it's probably
all those good deeds.

362
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:33,314
So time-consuming.

363
00:14:33,382 --> 00:14:35,116
Or... I was right.

364
00:14:35,184 --> 00:14:36,584
And Tim was back to his old ways.

365
00:14:36,652 --> 00:14:38,119
You know, that key
card we found in his wallet

366
00:14:38,187 --> 00:14:40,355
was from a hotel, so maybe
he was cheating on Vanessa,

367
00:14:40,423 --> 00:14:41,890
she found out,

368
00:14:41,957 --> 00:14:43,525
- then decided to...
- Punish the cheating bastard

369
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:44,893
by pumping him full of lead.

370
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,428
Well, that's option "A."

371
00:14:46,495 --> 00:14:48,196
Option "B" is the lawyer isn't
telling us everything he knows.

372
00:14:48,264 --> 00:14:49,431
Option "C" is

373
00:14:49,498 --> 00:14:51,433
an emotionally
distraught mistress did him in.

374
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,868
Ah, that old chestnut... if
I can't have him, no one can.

375
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:55,170
What did you get from Vanessa?

376
00:14:55,237 --> 00:14:56,438
- Is that why we're here?
- Yes, yes.

377
00:14:56,505 --> 00:14:57,572
She asked me to have lunch

378
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,340
with the golden donors of the foundation

379
00:14:59,408 --> 00:15:00,742
on her behalf.

380
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:01,943
It's the least I could do.

381
00:15:02,011 --> 00:15:03,278
Oh, the very least.

382
00:15:03,345 --> 00:15:05,714
What better way to get
intel on a murder than a gaggle

383
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:07,182
of high-society frenemies?

384
00:15:07,249 --> 00:15:08,650
- Oh.
- Ah!

385
00:15:08,718 --> 00:15:10,318
Tim Dunlear

386
00:15:10,386 --> 00:15:11,853
was a true humanitarian.

387
00:15:11,921 --> 00:15:13,888
Oh, there's so few of us around.

388
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:15,756
And I have no one to
help me process my grief.

389
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,559
Can you believe my
therapist had the nerve

390
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:18,626
to go on maternity leave?

391
00:15:18,661 --> 00:15:20,762
Oh, well, I'm here for you, Gayle.

392
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,964
You can tell me anything.

393
00:15:23,032 --> 00:15:24,599
Oh.

394
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:25,734
Oh, ooh...

395
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:29,637
You are a good man.

396
00:15:29,705 --> 00:15:31,239
Yeah, not quite the reaction

397
00:15:31,307 --> 00:15:34,342
I was looking for, but,
uh, when in Rome.

398
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,477
To Tim Dunlear.

399
00:15:35,544 --> 00:15:37,078
We all loved him.

400
00:15:37,146 --> 00:15:39,881
Mm-hmm, some more than others.

401
00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:41,616
So you heard about Donna Gray?

402
00:15:41,684 --> 00:15:43,451
- Oh, yeah.
- So sad.

403
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,887
Throwing yourself at a
married man like that.

404
00:15:45,955 --> 00:15:47,689
Mm, and when they
started sleeping together,

405
00:15:47,757 --> 00:15:49,724
poor Vanessa.

406
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:51,793
Tim turned Donna down cold.

407
00:15:51,861 --> 00:15:53,628
Not that it's any

408
00:15:53,696 --> 00:15:55,096
of your business.

409
00:15:55,164 --> 00:15:56,498
Oh.

410
00:15:59,135 --> 00:16:00,535
Tight-lipped and angry.

411
00:16:00,603 --> 00:16:02,137
Yes, well, with all that Botox,

412
00:16:02,204 --> 00:16:04,539
I'm surprised she can chew at all.

413
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:07,008
This is taking too long...
maybe we should do your hypnotism,

414
00:16:07,076 --> 00:16:09,027
eye-voodoo thing to get them talking.

415
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:09,701
Yes.

416
00:16:09,745 --> 00:16:12,013
You would expect that sort of
behavior from me, wouldn't you?

417
00:16:12,081 --> 00:16:14,149
Yeah, you making a
spectacle to help out a case.

418
00:16:14,216 --> 00:16:15,550
Yeah, it's what you do.

419
00:16:15,618 --> 00:16:17,552
Don't worry, Detective.
There'll be a spectacle.

420
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,187
These women

421
00:16:19,255 --> 00:16:21,689
are lonely and unappreciated.

422
00:16:21,757 --> 00:16:24,292
If I give them what they
want, they'll give us what we want.

423
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,661
Hello, ladies.

424
00:16:26,729 --> 00:16:30,064
Thank you all so much for coming today.

425
00:16:30,132 --> 00:16:32,167
Uh, you've all given so
generously over the years

426
00:16:32,234 --> 00:16:34,335
to the Dunlear Foundation.

427
00:16:34,403 --> 00:16:36,437
In honor of our fallen hero,

428
00:16:36,505 --> 00:16:38,072
I now give you a gift

429
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,180
in return.

430
00:16:39,241 --> 00:16:40,875
Me.

431
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:45,113
And he's breaking into song.

432
00:16:45,181 --> 00:16:48,082
 No cares for me 

433
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:51,886
 I'm happy as I can be 

434
00:16:51,954 --> 00:16:54,989
 I've learned to love and to live 

435
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:57,792
 Devil may care 

436
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,894
Gosh, you're lovely, aren't you?

437
00:16:59,962 --> 00:17:02,330
 When the day is through 

438
00:17:02,398 --> 00:17:06,201
 I'll suffer no regrets 

439
00:17:06,268 --> 00:17:09,470
 I know that he who frets 

440
00:17:09,538 --> 00:17:13,575
 Loses the night 

441
00:17:13,642 --> 00:17:16,477
 For only a fool feels 

442
00:17:16,545 --> 00:17:18,413
 He can hold back the dawn 

443
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,447
Don't hold back!

444
00:17:19,515 --> 00:17:21,449
 He who's wise never tries 

445
00:17:21,517 --> 00:17:23,017
-  To revise what's past... 
- Stop it! Stop!

446
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:26,120
What is wrong with you?!

447
00:17:26,188 --> 00:17:27,956
Why-why are you enjoying yourselves?!

448
00:17:28,023 --> 00:17:29,724
Tim is dead!

449
00:17:29,792 --> 00:17:31,659
Shame on you.

450
00:17:32,828 --> 00:17:34,495
And shame on all of you.

451
00:17:37,466 --> 00:17:40,235
And I give you option "D."

452
00:17:40,302 --> 00:17:41,870
Let's go.

453
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:44,115
- I love you.
- Thank you.

454
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:50,249
It's true.

455
00:17:50,443 --> 00:17:52,666
I loved him.

456
00:17:53,059 --> 00:17:55,599
Kyle, Tim Dunlear was
a hero to all of us.

457
00:17:55,627 --> 00:17:56,594
No, no.

458
00:17:56,662 --> 00:17:58,796
You don't understand.

459
00:18:00,232 --> 00:18:02,867
Tim and I were in love.

460
00:18:02,935 --> 00:18:04,569
- Oh.
- Oh.

461
00:18:04,636 --> 00:18:06,204
Right,

462
00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:08,673
so Tim was cheating on
his wife with a man.

463
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,274
I did not see that coming.

464
00:18:10,342 --> 00:18:12,443
The Devil usually has impeccable gaydar.

465
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:15,012
Tim was, uh, in denial

466
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,215
about his sexuality for years.

467
00:18:17,282 --> 00:18:20,451
And then, um...

468
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:22,153
we met.

469
00:18:22,221 --> 00:18:24,255
Hmm, that explains
why he was never at home

470
00:18:24,323 --> 00:18:25,756
and all the secrecy.

471
00:18:25,824 --> 00:18:27,625
Did you two ever meet at a hotel?

472
00:18:27,693 --> 00:18:29,060
No.

473
00:18:29,128 --> 00:18:30,761
No, that-that would've been too public.

474
00:18:30,829 --> 00:18:33,898
Uh, we only ever met at my apartment.

475
00:18:33,966 --> 00:18:35,333
Huh. What about Vanessa?

476
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,501
Did she know?

477
00:18:36,568 --> 00:18:38,169
They, um,

478
00:18:38,237 --> 00:18:39,604
you know, they-they had an arrangement.

479
00:18:39,671 --> 00:18:42,306
Tim wanted it kept secret.

480
00:18:42,374 --> 00:18:44,509
And Vanessa agreed.

481
00:18:44,576 --> 00:18:47,945
She needed the Tim Dunlear brand.

482
00:18:48,013 --> 00:18:49,947
Monogamy fails again.

483
00:18:50,015 --> 00:18:51,449
So, if Tim didn't want
out of the closet,

484
00:18:51,517 --> 00:18:54,152
were you aware of anyone
that would want to blackmail him?

485
00:18:54,219 --> 00:18:56,053
Or threaten to go to the press?

486
00:18:56,121 --> 00:18:57,221
No.

487
00:18:57,289 --> 00:18:58,256
Um...

488
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:02,226
But Tim texted me this photo

489
00:19:02,294 --> 00:19:03,461
for safekeeping.

490
00:19:03,529 --> 00:19:05,730
I... I have no idea

491
00:19:05,797 --> 00:19:08,099
what it means.

492
00:19:08,167 --> 00:19:10,635
- Hmm.
- It's actually the last I ever

493
00:19:10,702 --> 00:19:12,770
heard from him before...

494
00:19:15,908 --> 00:19:18,075
Do you want another song?

495
00:19:20,112 --> 00:19:23,414
If there's one thing I
know about kimchi fried rice,

496
00:19:23,482 --> 00:19:27,885
it's that heat really kicks
things up a notch.

497
00:19:27,953 --> 00:19:30,221
You almost died. You came back,

498
00:19:30,289 --> 00:19:32,169
and this is what you do
with your second chance?

499
00:19:35,794 --> 00:19:38,729
You know what happens when you die?

500
00:19:38,797 --> 00:19:40,932
I can't say I do.

501
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:43,568
Well, if you've lived a life

502
00:19:43,635 --> 00:19:46,504
like I did, you go to Hell.

503
00:19:46,572 --> 00:19:47,805
Oh, yeah.

504
00:19:47,873 --> 00:19:50,942
In my case, it was
for a couple of seconds.

505
00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:54,378
Down there, though, it was years...

506
00:19:54,446 --> 00:19:56,080
and years.

507
00:19:56,148 --> 00:19:57,815
And there's a door just for you.

508
00:19:57,883 --> 00:20:00,051
And inside, Hell

509
00:20:00,118 --> 00:20:02,753
uses what you love against you.

510
00:20:02,821 --> 00:20:06,023
For me, I love life.

511
00:20:06,091 --> 00:20:09,093
Everything about
it. Got a hunger for it.

512
00:20:09,161 --> 00:20:11,462
So...

513
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:13,631
they starved me.

514
00:20:13,699 --> 00:20:15,466
No food.

515
00:20:15,534 --> 00:20:17,268
No other people.

516
00:20:17,336 --> 00:20:18,603
No nothing.

517
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,438
No TV.

518
00:20:20,505 --> 00:20:22,006
Malcolm?

519
00:20:22,074 --> 00:20:23,407
Hmm?

520
00:20:23,475 --> 00:20:24,875
You need help.

521
00:20:32,517 --> 00:20:34,418
You always were a scrappy one.

522
00:20:34,486 --> 00:20:37,288
Ah.

523
00:20:37,356 --> 00:20:39,824
Yeah.

524
00:20:39,891 --> 00:20:42,526
I do need help.

525
00:20:42,594 --> 00:20:44,595
Never to go back.

526
00:20:44,663 --> 00:20:45,997
So I made a deal.

527
00:20:46,064 --> 00:20:47,832
And all I got to do

528
00:20:47,899 --> 00:20:50,434
is put a bullet in Lucifer.

529
00:20:50,502 --> 00:20:52,770
I pull the trigger.

530
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,974
You take the fall.

531
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,177
Huh?

532
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,714
Huh? Huh?

533
00:21:11,857 --> 00:21:14,759
Five-second rule.

534
00:21:23,602 --> 00:21:25,303
Teaching,

535
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:27,104
building,

536
00:21:27,172 --> 00:21:28,673
creating.

537
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,107
I'm Tim Dunlear.

538
00:21:30,175 --> 00:21:31,676
Together we can educate Haiti today

539
00:21:31,743 --> 00:21:34,011
for their better tomorrow.

540
00:21:44,489 --> 00:21:46,424
Mr. Fleming?

541
00:21:46,491 --> 00:21:47,825
What are you doing here?

542
00:21:47,893 --> 00:21:49,327
I understand you've been asking

543
00:21:49,394 --> 00:21:51,195
some pretty invasive questions
at a luncheon.

544
00:21:51,263 --> 00:21:53,264
I have reason to
believe that your client

545
00:21:53,332 --> 00:21:56,033
knows more than she's letting
on about her husband's death.

546
00:21:56,101 --> 00:21:58,035
Vanessa Dunlear's entire
world has fallen apart.

547
00:21:58,103 --> 00:22:00,638
I mean, what kind of a
person targets a-a grieving woman?

548
00:22:00,706 --> 00:22:02,406
A very rich grieving woman

549
00:22:02,474 --> 00:22:04,175
who stands to
inherit her husband's estate.

550
00:22:04,242 --> 00:22:07,678
Every cent that Tim had goes
back into that foundation.

551
00:22:09,348 --> 00:22:10,614
Which you would know,

552
00:22:10,682 --> 00:22:12,883
because now that Tim's
gone, you took control.

553
00:22:12,951 --> 00:22:14,485
That's an interesting turn of events.

554
00:22:14,553 --> 00:22:16,654
You are messing with the
wrong people, Detective.

555
00:22:16,722 --> 00:22:18,522
Good people.

556
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,724
Back off.

557
00:22:27,899 --> 00:22:30,434
You'd never know that Lux
was a den of iniquity, would you?

558
00:22:30,502 --> 00:22:33,304
Well, as long as you don't look
too closely at the floors.

559
00:22:33,372 --> 00:22:35,439
Will Fleming wants to scare me off?

560
00:22:35,507 --> 00:22:36,907
Bring it on.

561
00:22:36,975 --> 00:22:39,377
Question is, whether he's protecting
himself or Vanessa.

562
00:22:39,444 --> 00:22:42,046
Or maybe they're just good people.

563
00:22:42,114 --> 00:22:43,594
Because you're suddenly the authority?

564
00:22:43,615 --> 00:22:44,615
Give me a break.

565
00:22:44,683 --> 00:22:47,852
Detective, even if Vanessa is guilty,

566
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,721
this is a woman who's
denied herself carbs since the '90s

567
00:22:50,822 --> 00:22:52,102
and stayed married to a gay man.

568
00:22:52,157 --> 00:22:54,091
If she doesn't want to talk, she won't.

569
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,926
And as for their attorney,

570
00:22:55,994 --> 00:22:57,394
well, he certainly doesn't strike me

571
00:22:57,396 --> 00:22:58,929
as the confessional type. Okay.

572
00:22:58,997 --> 00:23:01,499
Maybe I can't get them
to talk, but you can.

573
00:23:01,566 --> 00:23:02,500
Come on.

574
00:23:02,567 --> 00:23:03,634
I've seen you do it dozens of times.

575
00:23:03,702 --> 00:23:04,635
No.

576
00:23:04,703 --> 00:23:06,437
Not here. Not tonight.

577
00:23:06,505 --> 00:23:07,772
Am I missing something?

578
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:09,940
I feel like you're
protecting our main suspects.

579
00:23:10,008 --> 00:23:11,909
No, I'm just
thinking about the children.

580
00:23:11,977 --> 00:23:15,312
You want to push pause on
a murder investigation

581
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,914
so you can have a party?

582
00:23:16,982 --> 00:23:18,315
Detective, I made a promise.

583
00:23:18,383 --> 00:23:20,551
The ladies, the-the foundation,

584
00:23:20,619 --> 00:23:22,820
the proud nation of Haiti...

585
00:23:22,888 --> 00:23:24,355
they're all depending on me

586
00:23:24,423 --> 00:23:25,556
tonight.

587
00:23:25,624 --> 00:23:27,391
Now, Tim Dunlear may be dead,

588
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:28,659
but his legacy lives on,

589
00:23:28,727 --> 00:23:31,195
and right now he needs
to go change into his tux.

590
00:23:31,263 --> 00:23:34,131
It's about the greater good, Detective.

591
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:37,034
The greater good would
be parking your ego

592
00:23:37,102 --> 00:23:39,703
and helping catch the bad guy.

593
00:23:39,771 --> 00:23:41,172
The old Lucifer would have known that.

594
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:42,306
Wh...

595
00:23:42,374 --> 00:23:44,275
I miss him, by the way.

596
00:23:45,877 --> 00:23:47,812
At least he had my back.

597
00:23:50,215 --> 00:23:52,116
Detective!

598
00:24:02,928 --> 00:24:04,267
Oh...

599
00:24:04,637 --> 00:24:07,883
Glad someone's having a good night.

600
00:24:10,553 --> 00:24:12,054
What are you doing here?

601
00:24:12,122 --> 00:24:14,256
You've ruined my life.

602
00:24:14,324 --> 00:24:17,059
The least I could do is ruin your night.

603
00:24:17,127 --> 00:24:20,062
Enjoy your evening.

604
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,396
How'd you even find me, Maze?

605
00:24:21,464 --> 00:24:23,899
Followed the sweet stench of failure.

606
00:24:25,502 --> 00:24:27,462
Look, don't blame me for
your problems, all right?

607
00:24:27,504 --> 00:24:28,570
It's not my fault

608
00:24:28,638 --> 00:24:30,139
that you betrayed your boss.

609
00:24:30,206 --> 00:24:33,675
My problems are your problems.

610
00:24:33,743 --> 00:24:36,345
Which would be the only thing
that you and I have in common.

611
00:24:36,412 --> 00:24:37,780
And so you came here because...

612
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:41,016
because you have

613
00:24:41,084 --> 00:24:42,217
nowhere else to go?

614
00:24:42,285 --> 00:24:44,353
Yes, I do.

615
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,255
I have lots of places to go.

616
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,490
Lots of places.

617
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:51,160
And because you have no
one else to talk to, either.

618
00:24:52,228 --> 00:24:54,029
Says the angel sitting here

619
00:24:54,097 --> 00:24:56,298
eating a medium rare steak

620
00:24:56,366 --> 00:24:57,866
by himself.

621
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:09,411
What?

622
00:25:09,479 --> 00:25:11,413
It's not like you
were going to drink it.

623
00:25:11,481 --> 00:25:12,414
You're so boring.

624
00:25:12,482 --> 00:25:14,183
I'm actually not boring.

625
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,385
I'm pretty exciting.

626
00:25:20,323 --> 00:25:23,492
My definition of "excitement"

627
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,093
is fun.

628
00:25:25,161 --> 00:25:26,862
Danger.

629
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,297
Sex.

630
00:25:29,232 --> 00:25:30,532
Spontaneity.

631
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,601
You are none of those things.

632
00:25:36,105 --> 00:25:37,039
Yes, I am.

633
00:25:37,106 --> 00:25:38,640
Give me one example.

634
00:25:42,478 --> 00:25:44,980
You know that story about
Lucifer and the goat?

635
00:25:45,048 --> 00:25:47,449
Yeah?

636
00:25:49,219 --> 00:25:50,719
No.

637
00:25:52,355 --> 00:25:53,088
That was you?

638
00:25:53,156 --> 00:25:54,389
That was me.

639
00:25:54,457 --> 00:25:55,524
A whisper here,

640
00:25:55,592 --> 00:25:58,827
a divine appearance there...

641
00:25:58,895 --> 00:26:00,729
Word got around.

642
00:26:00,797 --> 00:26:02,130
He hates the goat thing.

643
00:26:02,198 --> 00:26:03,198
I know!

644
00:26:03,266 --> 00:26:04,733
He could never figure out

645
00:26:04,801 --> 00:26:06,201
where it came from.

646
00:26:06,269 --> 00:26:09,104
You know, I've waited a
thousand years to tell someone that.

647
00:26:16,212 --> 00:26:17,646
Leave the bottle.

648
00:26:22,112 --> 00:26:24,686
Thanks for this, Kyle. I
know it's your job on the line.

649
00:26:24,754 --> 00:26:25,787
Whatever it takes.

650
00:26:27,991 --> 00:26:29,224
I want to find who did this.

651
00:26:30,093 --> 00:26:31,660
Thank you.

652
00:26:33,463 --> 00:26:36,365
So this here, this last text from Tim...

653
00:26:36,432 --> 00:26:37,733
looks like it was from
Port-au-Prince.

654
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,067
Tim didn't tell me

655
00:26:39,135 --> 00:26:40,469
he was going there.

656
00:26:40,536 --> 00:26:41,937
It wasn't on his calendar.

657
00:26:43,773 --> 00:26:45,841
Could he have traveled under the radar?

658
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:49,912
Sometimes he booked his own travel.

659
00:26:49,979 --> 00:26:51,179
He-he had some buddies

660
00:26:51,247 --> 00:26:52,314
who own private jets.

661
00:26:52,382 --> 00:26:53,715
Sometimes they would travel as a group.

662
00:26:53,783 --> 00:26:55,550
So if Tim stayed in a hotel there,

663
00:26:55,618 --> 00:26:57,058
maybe that's why he had the key card.

664
00:26:57,086 --> 00:26:58,086
Third-world technology.

665
00:26:58,154 --> 00:26:59,154
Maybe that's why

666
00:26:59,222 --> 00:27:01,256
we couldn't read the magnetic strip.

667
00:27:01,324 --> 00:27:03,425
We do charity work in Port-au-Prince.

668
00:27:03,493 --> 00:27:05,827
We raised money to buy
land to build a school.

669
00:27:05,895 --> 00:27:08,130
Maybe that's what the
text of the barren field was.

670
00:27:08,197 --> 00:27:09,597
That photo was from a few days ago.

671
00:27:09,632 --> 00:27:12,200
The school would be almost
finished by now.

672
00:27:13,603 --> 00:27:15,604
Unless it was never built.

673
00:27:16,706 --> 00:27:19,141
Unless the money the foundation raised

674
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:21,610
went somewhere else.

675
00:27:23,513 --> 00:27:25,614
Or to someone else.

676
00:27:39,362 --> 00:27:41,763
Really?

677
00:27:41,831 --> 00:27:43,999
That's your move?

678
00:27:44,067 --> 00:27:46,234
You were planning to seduce me?

679
00:27:46,302 --> 00:27:48,236
That is... truly desperate.

680
00:27:48,304 --> 00:27:50,138
I'm not here to seduce you, Will.

681
00:27:51,207 --> 00:27:52,708
But I do know what you desire.

682
00:27:54,444 --> 00:27:55,844
What is it you think I desire,

683
00:27:55,912 --> 00:27:57,546
Detective?

684
00:27:57,613 --> 00:27:58,680
To do good.

685
00:27:58,748 --> 00:28:00,382
To help people.

686
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,384
I did some research into you, Will,

687
00:28:02,452 --> 00:28:03,785
and apparently, you don't charge

688
00:28:03,853 --> 00:28:06,121
for your services here
at the foundation.

689
00:28:06,189 --> 00:28:07,255
I make a nice living,

690
00:28:07,323 --> 00:28:08,690
thanks to my corporate work.

691
00:28:08,758 --> 00:28:10,459
Yeah, you protect your
clients like a bulldog,

692
00:28:10,526 --> 00:28:12,561
but underneath it all, you're
a big softie, aren't you?

693
00:28:12,628 --> 00:28:15,964
I don't need to take
money away from those kids.

694
00:28:16,032 --> 00:28:17,766
No.

695
00:28:17,834 --> 00:28:19,101
But Vanessa does.

696
00:28:19,168 --> 00:28:20,035
What the hell does that mean?

697
00:28:20,103 --> 00:28:21,303
I looked into a school

698
00:28:21,371 --> 00:28:22,604
that was supposed to be built

699
00:28:22,672 --> 00:28:24,272
with the foundation's
money in Port-au-Prince.

700
00:28:26,342 --> 00:28:28,210
It doesn't exist.

701
00:28:29,112 --> 00:28:30,545
What?

702
00:28:30,613 --> 00:28:31,933
I think the money went elsewhere.

703
00:28:31,948 --> 00:28:34,449
After all, Vanessa had a
hell of an expensive lifestyle

704
00:28:34,517 --> 00:28:36,718
to keep up after her
husband left the NBA.

705
00:28:36,786 --> 00:28:38,186
That is ridiculous.

706
00:28:38,254 --> 00:28:41,490
Besides, non-profit financials
are a matter of public record.

707
00:28:41,557 --> 00:28:42,824
They are.

708
00:28:42,892 --> 00:28:44,626
But they're so
complicated, it would be pretty easy

709
00:28:44,694 --> 00:28:47,062
to hide a few outgoing wire transfers.

710
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,997
Here. I think Tim Dunlear

711
00:28:49,065 --> 00:28:50,766
looked into these
financials and figured it out.

712
00:28:50,833 --> 00:28:53,201
So he flew to Pout Au
Prince to see for himself,

713
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:54,336
and when he realized

714
00:28:54,404 --> 00:28:55,937
where the money went,

715
00:28:56,005 --> 00:28:57,706
he confronted Vanessa

716
00:28:57,774 --> 00:28:59,307
and she killed him.

717
00:29:00,176 --> 00:29:01,977
That is pure speculation.

718
00:29:02,045 --> 00:29:02,978
It is.

719
00:29:03,046 --> 00:29:04,479
So help me get proof.

720
00:29:04,547 --> 00:29:06,648
If Vanessa transferred money to herself,

721
00:29:06,716 --> 00:29:08,517
it'll show up in her personal
financial records,

722
00:29:08,584 --> 00:29:10,385
which you have access to.

723
00:29:10,453 --> 00:29:12,220
You want me to violate my client's trust

724
00:29:12,288 --> 00:29:13,488
based on a hunch?

725
00:29:13,556 --> 00:29:15,624
You took this job to make a difference.

726
00:29:15,691 --> 00:29:18,160
This foundation can still do good

727
00:29:18,227 --> 00:29:20,028
the way Tim wanted it to.

728
00:29:20,096 --> 00:29:21,596
If you help me.

729
00:30:06,242 --> 00:30:07,676
Detective.

730
00:30:07,743 --> 00:30:08,577
Is that you?

731
00:30:08,644 --> 00:30:10,612
Hope you've come to your senses.

732
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,115
Well, that depends on
who you ask, Mr. Morningstar.

733
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:15,851
I'm here to murder you.

734
00:30:17,153 --> 00:30:20,255
Well... that is a buzzkill.

735
00:30:25,677 --> 00:30:26,608
I'm sorry.

736
00:30:26,609 --> 00:30:27,876
Strange, disheveled gunman,

737
00:30:27,943 --> 00:30:29,044
have we met?

738
00:30:29,111 --> 00:30:31,012
Briefly.

739
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,681
Detective Malcolm Graham.

740
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,316
Ah, yes, of course!

741
00:30:34,383 --> 00:30:35,684
The infamous Malcolm.

742
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,053
Tough times?

743
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,220
You here to steal my watch?

744
00:30:39,288 --> 00:30:40,555
Well, there's no need.

745
00:30:40,623 --> 00:30:43,158
You've caught me in a charitable mood.

746
00:30:43,225 --> 00:30:44,545
You could also use a decent suit.

747
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:45,760
The closet's that way.

748
00:30:45,828 --> 00:30:46,961
Thanks.

749
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:48,496
I'm still going to kill you.

750
00:30:48,564 --> 00:30:49,831
Ah...

751
00:30:49,899 --> 00:30:51,866
I should also mention
that if you pull that trigger,

752
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:54,469
it's a one-way ticket
to eternal damnation.

753
00:30:54,537 --> 00:30:55,470
Hell?

754
00:30:56,372 --> 00:30:58,406
Oh, I'm not going to Hell.

755
00:30:58,474 --> 00:30:59,641
Now or ever again.

756
00:30:59,709 --> 00:31:00,642
No?

757
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:03,111
See, I made a deal with an angel.

758
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:05,747
And I've got orders to take you out.

759
00:31:05,815 --> 00:31:07,749
Your ass for mine.

760
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,187
Sorry, it's...

761
00:31:12,254 --> 00:31:15,290
My holier-than-thou brother
has hired someone to kill me?

762
00:31:15,358 --> 00:31:17,492
Well, this really is Opposite
Day, isn't it?

763
00:31:19,428 --> 00:31:20,595
You know what, Malcolm?

764
00:31:22,231 --> 00:31:24,532
It's nighttime now.

765
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,836
It's funny how things seem
so much clearer in the dark.

766
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:33,575
Is that all you got?

767
00:31:35,378 --> 00:31:36,578
Interesting.

768
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:39,981
Most people wet themselves when
they see my nastier side.

769
00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:41,316
Huh.

770
00:31:41,384 --> 00:31:43,318
Well, most people
haven't been to Hell and back.

771
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,488
Rumor says

772
00:31:46,555 --> 00:31:48,089
you're not immortal anymore.

773
00:31:48,157 --> 00:31:50,392
That if I pull this trigger,

774
00:31:50,459 --> 00:31:52,093
it's bye-bye, Devil.

775
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:53,395
Of course.

776
00:31:53,462 --> 00:31:55,463
Right. And what do you get in return,

777
00:31:55,531 --> 00:31:56,498
Malcolm?

778
00:31:56,565 --> 00:31:58,199
Your brother doesn't kill me.

779
00:31:58,267 --> 00:32:01,169
I stay out of Hell, live out my life.

780
00:32:01,237 --> 00:32:02,737
I love life.

781
00:32:07,476 --> 00:32:09,477
You've been duped, Malcolm.

782
00:32:09,545 --> 00:32:10,378
Huh?

783
00:32:10,446 --> 00:32:12,113
Angels can't take a mortal life.

784
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:13,281
It's Dad's rules.

785
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:15,183
Sorry.

786
00:32:15,251 --> 00:32:18,520
And even if you do kill me...

787
00:32:18,587 --> 00:32:20,388
what happens when you do die?

788
00:32:20,456 --> 00:32:23,458
Because you will... eventually.

789
00:32:23,526 --> 00:32:25,260
You'll still go back to Hell, Malcolm.

790
00:32:25,327 --> 00:32:26,394
There's nothing

791
00:32:26,462 --> 00:32:29,297
that my brother can do to prevent that.

792
00:32:33,102 --> 00:32:34,169
What's that?

793
00:32:34,236 --> 00:32:35,637
This?

794
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:37,906
This is my Pentecostal coin.

795
00:32:37,973 --> 00:32:42,310
It's a subway token for
the damned, if you will.

796
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:46,314
I was going to use it to
get back to Hell eventually.

797
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:49,851
I suppose you could use
it to get out of Hell, too.

798
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,288
Could come in handy
for someone like you,

799
00:32:53,355 --> 00:32:54,756
don't you think, Malcolm?

800
00:32:58,627 --> 00:33:01,496
It's all yours if you don't shoot me.

801
00:33:03,766 --> 00:33:05,800
One-time offer.

802
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:13,134
There you are.

803
00:34:13,202 --> 00:34:15,837
Can't very well start our
party without our guest of honor.

804
00:34:15,905 --> 00:34:16,938
Mrs. Dunlear.

805
00:34:17,006 --> 00:34:19,474
Are you okay?

806
00:34:19,542 --> 00:34:22,210
Yes, yes, I just
needed a little pick-me-up.

807
00:34:22,278 --> 00:34:23,611
It's been an exhausting day.

808
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,614
Facing one's mortality will do that.

809
00:34:26,682 --> 00:34:29,384
I think we'll all
deserve a vacation after tonight,

810
00:34:29,451 --> 00:34:31,352
a chance to mourn Tim properly.

811
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,187
I fly out tomorrow.

812
00:34:33,255 --> 00:34:36,324
One of those Swiss med spas
that masquerades as a resort?

813
00:34:36,392 --> 00:34:37,592
No.

814
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:40,461
No, I own a small ranch
outside of Buenos Aires.

815
00:34:40,529 --> 00:34:41,863
Lovely.

816
00:34:41,931 --> 00:34:43,865
I knew some folks who moved to
Buenos Aires back in the day.

817
00:34:43,933 --> 00:34:45,667
Oh. Good people?

818
00:34:45,734 --> 00:34:49,404
Nazis. No extradition
treaty in Argentina.

819
00:34:49,471 --> 00:34:53,274
Just a nasty bunch of
miscreants hiding in plain sight.

820
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:54,742
Gosh, they got away with murder.

821
00:35:00,049 --> 00:35:03,184
You did kill your husband, didn't you?

822
00:35:03,252 --> 00:35:05,019
No, that's absurd.

823
00:35:05,087 --> 00:35:06,767
I have to admit, I'm
not entirely sure why,

824
00:35:06,822 --> 00:35:08,289
but Detective Decker will figure it out.

825
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:09,290
She always does.

826
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:10,558
I loved him.

827
00:35:10,626 --> 00:35:11,993
And Tim loved me.

828
00:35:12,061 --> 00:35:13,828
Well, no, technically, he
loved your assistant, Kyle.

829
00:35:13,896 --> 00:35:17,699
Yes, but I... I would never...

830
00:35:18,901 --> 00:35:20,034
Tim was a good man.

831
00:35:20,102 --> 00:35:21,369
He was selfless...

832
00:35:21,437 --> 00:35:23,371
Yes.

833
00:35:23,439 --> 00:35:24,772
Yes, he was.

834
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,775
Everybody loved Tim, and he
asked for nothing in return,

835
00:35:27,843 --> 00:35:30,278
not even his own happiness.

836
00:35:30,346 --> 00:35:33,748
Well, as the old saying goes,
you can't keep a good man down,

837
00:35:33,816 --> 00:35:35,483
not even in death.

838
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:39,020
So how about we go downstairs,

839
00:35:39,088 --> 00:35:41,756
see this night through, and then...

840
00:35:42,658 --> 00:35:44,325
Oh, bloody hell.

841
00:35:51,606 --> 00:35:53,100
Lucifer!

842
00:35:53,101 --> 00:35:55,314
Where's Lucifer?

843
00:35:55,381 --> 00:35:58,650
Lucifer Morningstar, where is he?

844
00:35:58,718 --> 00:35:59,718
Out of the way.

845
00:35:59,786 --> 00:36:01,653
Hey!

846
00:36:15,301 --> 00:36:16,435
You're alive.

847
00:36:17,971 --> 00:36:20,439
Yes.

848
00:36:20,507 --> 00:36:22,508
Yes, it would appear
that way, wouldn't it?

849
00:36:22,575 --> 00:36:25,711
What are you doing here?

850
00:36:25,778 --> 00:36:28,780
I came to stop Malcolm; he's
planning to shoot you.

851
00:36:28,848 --> 00:36:30,082
Malcolm?

852
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:32,084
No, no, this wasn't him.

853
00:36:32,152 --> 00:36:33,919
He's taken care of.

854
00:36:33,987 --> 00:36:36,355
He is?

855
00:36:36,422 --> 00:36:37,823
How?

856
00:36:37,891 --> 00:36:40,325
Well, I made him an
offer that he couldn't...

857
00:36:40,393 --> 00:36:42,294
You know the line.

858
00:36:42,362 --> 00:36:44,296
You look terrible, by the way.

859
00:36:44,364 --> 00:36:45,764
Rough day at the office?

860
00:36:45,832 --> 00:36:47,666
Uh, yeah.

861
00:36:47,734 --> 00:36:49,134
Yeah, you could say that.

862
00:36:49,202 --> 00:36:52,171
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I've got a charity to attend

863
00:36:52,238 --> 00:36:54,072
and a killer to punish.

864
00:36:55,308 --> 00:36:56,475
How do I look?

865
00:36:57,977 --> 00:36:59,678
Pretty good, actually.

866
00:36:59,746 --> 00:37:01,947
Yes, I thought as much.

867
00:37:02,015 --> 00:37:05,918
Oh, have a drink.

868
00:37:05,985 --> 00:37:07,452
Two, if you like.

869
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,122
Who says the Devil can't be charitable?

870
00:37:11,491 --> 00:37:14,927
Thank you all so
much for your generosity.

871
00:37:14,994 --> 00:37:18,197
I would also like to
thank our host, Mr. Morningstar.

872
00:37:18,264 --> 00:37:21,867
He was going to say a few
words, but unfortunately he's been...

873
00:37:21,935 --> 00:37:23,702
Right on time.

874
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:26,438
How are we all this evening, eh?

875
00:37:26,506 --> 00:37:28,207
Such a well-preserved crowd.

876
00:37:28,274 --> 00:37:30,242
Love your work, Dr. Broffman.

877
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:31,877
Tucking marvelous.

878
00:37:31,945 --> 00:37:36,281
Right, we're all here to
honor Tim Dunlear's legacy,

879
00:37:36,349 --> 00:37:40,219
and what better way to do
that than to reveal his killer?

880
00:37:41,621 --> 00:37:44,156
Wouldn't you agree, Mrs. Dunlear?

881
00:37:44,224 --> 00:37:47,159
Time to show your
friends your true colors.

882
00:37:47,227 --> 00:37:50,229
Tell them all your nasty desires.

883
00:37:51,831 --> 00:37:53,765
No need.

884
00:37:53,833 --> 00:37:55,567
We already have everything,

885
00:37:55,635 --> 00:37:58,403
how she embezzled
money from the foundation,

886
00:37:58,471 --> 00:38:01,173
and when Tim found out
about it, you killed him.

887
00:38:01,241 --> 00:38:02,321
Ah, see?

888
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:03,495
Told you she'd figure it out.

889
00:38:03,509 --> 00:38:05,611
You have no proof.

890
00:38:05,678 --> 00:38:06,745
Actually, we do.

891
00:38:06,813 --> 00:38:08,280
We have
proof of the embezzlement,

892
00:38:08,348 --> 00:38:10,115
and that's enough for probable cause.

893
00:38:10,183 --> 00:38:12,584
Vanessa...

894
00:38:13,953 --> 00:38:16,421
I earned that money.

895
00:38:16,489 --> 00:38:19,157
I supported him when he left pro ball.

896
00:38:19,225 --> 00:38:21,059
I let him sleep with my assistant.

897
00:38:21,127 --> 00:38:22,794
- Oh.
- That money should go to me,

898
00:38:22,862 --> 00:38:24,329
not those kids.

899
00:38:24,397 --> 00:38:26,031
Tim was going to ruin everything.

900
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:28,300
I had to.

901
00:38:28,368 --> 00:38:31,270
Now, doesn't that feel better?

902
00:38:31,337 --> 00:38:32,738
Huh?

903
00:38:32,805 --> 00:38:34,245
Vanessa Dunlear, you're under arrest

904
00:38:34,274 --> 00:38:35,674
for the murder of Tim Dunlear.

905
00:38:38,344 --> 00:38:39,978
Thank you.

906
00:38:40,046 --> 00:38:41,513
You're welcome.

907
00:38:45,318 --> 00:38:49,921
There it is again, that rush.

908
00:38:59,365 --> 00:39:01,366
Looks like someone had a good night.

909
00:39:05,338 --> 00:39:07,506
I know bed head when I see it.

910
00:39:11,244 --> 00:39:12,911
We're talking again?

911
00:39:14,247 --> 00:39:17,516
Well... life's too
short to hold grudges.

912
00:39:19,786 --> 00:39:22,454
Doesn't mean all is forgiven, mind.

913
00:39:22,522 --> 00:39:24,923
I mean, you'd have to do something
pretty extraordinary

914
00:39:24,991 --> 00:39:26,391
to wipe this slate clean.

915
00:39:34,267 --> 00:39:36,535
I had sex with your brother.

916
00:39:40,707 --> 00:39:45,344
And that puts you in my
good graces how exactly?

917
00:39:45,411 --> 00:39:49,881
Well, I was his inside
woman, and now I'm yours.

918
00:39:51,684 --> 00:39:55,654
Yes, well, I suppose that
could come in handy,

919
00:39:55,722 --> 00:39:58,123
especially since he
just tried to kill me.

920
00:39:58,191 --> 00:39:59,519
What?!

921
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,993
- Wait, you were shot?
- Mm-hmm.

922
00:40:02,061 --> 00:40:03,261
And you didn't bleed?

923
00:40:03,329 --> 00:40:05,263
He hired a gunman.

924
00:40:05,331 --> 00:40:06,798
I mean, I talked the chap out of it,

925
00:40:06,866 --> 00:40:08,800
but then this demented socialite...

926
00:40:08,868 --> 00:40:11,770
I mean, it's a long
story, but I survived,

927
00:40:11,838 --> 00:40:15,140
which is more than can
be said for my Armani.

928
00:40:15,208 --> 00:40:16,128
But I don't understand.

929
00:40:16,175 --> 00:40:17,409
How could you still be alive?

930
00:40:17,477 --> 00:40:19,745
Well, that is the question,
isn't it, Maze?

931
00:40:19,812 --> 00:40:23,648
Why is it that sometimes I'm immortal...

932
00:40:25,284 --> 00:40:27,853
and other times I'm all too human.

933
00:40:35,161 --> 00:40:36,795
Oh, that's interesting.

934
00:40:36,863 --> 00:40:39,164
What?

935
00:40:39,232 --> 00:40:41,900
I need to go and test a theory.

936
00:40:45,238 --> 00:40:47,606
Oh, and, um...

937
00:40:49,942 --> 00:40:51,977
tread carefully, Maze.

938
00:41:14,267 --> 00:41:15,600
May I come in?

939
00:41:15,668 --> 00:41:17,869
Who? St. Lucifer or the Devil?

940
00:41:17,937 --> 00:41:21,273
Yes, rest
assured, St. Lucifer's retired.

941
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:25,944
Really?

942
00:41:26,012 --> 00:41:28,613
'Cause I just got a text
from Kyle saying that someone gave

943
00:41:28,681 --> 00:41:31,983
money to Emmett
Toussaint's scholarship fund,

944
00:41:32,051 --> 00:41:34,186
enough for a full ride.

945
00:41:34,253 --> 00:41:36,321
An anonymous donor.

946
00:41:36,389 --> 00:41:38,790
Well, good for Emmett.

947
00:41:38,858 --> 00:41:40,459
Glad it worked out.

948
00:41:40,526 --> 00:41:42,060
Mm-hmm.

949
00:41:42,128 --> 00:41:43,328
- Listen, Detective, I...
- I want...

950
00:41:43,396 --> 00:41:44,529
- Oh.
- Sorry.

951
00:41:44,597 --> 00:41:45,831
No, you.

952
00:41:48,634 --> 00:41:53,205
Um, I've been thinking a
lot about the other night,

953
00:41:53,272 --> 00:41:57,242
why I showed up drunk to your place,

954
00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:01,813
why you wouldn't sleep with me,

955
00:42:01,881 --> 00:42:04,349
and I think us,

956
00:42:04,417 --> 00:42:07,352
our thing,

957
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:10,622
maybe it goes beyond just work.

958
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:12,891
- Or sex.
- What sex?

959
00:42:12,959 --> 00:42:16,228
Congratulations, the first
woman to give the Devil blue balls.

960
00:42:16,295 --> 00:42:18,964
Anyhow,

961
00:42:19,031 --> 00:42:22,601
I, uh, I just...

962
00:42:25,304 --> 00:42:29,641
I can let my guard down with you.

963
00:42:29,709 --> 00:42:31,743
I don't do that with anyone else.

964
00:42:31,811 --> 00:42:34,679
You make me vulnerable.

965
00:42:34,747 --> 00:42:38,917
And... maybe that's okay.

966
00:42:42,221 --> 00:42:44,623
Detective...

967
00:42:46,926 --> 00:42:50,862
if it's any consolation to your pride...

968
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:54,588
it appears you make me vulnerable, too.

58
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:51,167
Oops.

59
00:02:51,234 --> 00:02:54,470
You know exactly what's causing
your vulnerability.

60
00:02:54,538 --> 00:02:56,698
Chloe Decker is the one I
should be throwing knives at.

61
00:02:56,707 --> 00:02:58,107
Who knows what she's hiding.

62
00:02:58,175 --> 00:03:00,743
Yes, she seems to be the
one thing that can hurt me,

63
00:03:00,811 --> 00:03:02,111
but there may be other things as well.

64
00:03:02,179 --> 00:03:04,613
The detective may simply
be a cog in a bigger machine.

65
00:03:04,681 --> 00:03:06,749
This is called being thorough.

66
00:03:06,817 --> 00:03:07,917
More like denial.

67
00:03:07,984 --> 00:03:09,285
Because if you really thought

68
00:03:09,353 --> 00:03:10,753
that I could hurt you with these,

69
00:03:10,821 --> 00:03:12,088
you wouldn't let me

70
00:03:12,155 --> 00:03:13,489
throw them at you.

71
00:03:15,292 --> 00:03:16,959
Very funny.

72
00:03:17,027 --> 00:03:19,061
Demon daggers forged
in Hell don't count.

73
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:21,931
We all know those prick.

74
00:03:22,999 --> 00:03:25,034
And speaking of,

75
00:03:25,102 --> 00:03:27,636
how's my brother?

76
00:03:27,704 --> 00:03:30,439
Three weeks of a whole lot of this?

77
00:03:30,507 --> 00:03:32,775
How do you think he's doing?

78
00:03:32,843 --> 00:03:34,243
You're not going steady, Maze.

79
00:03:34,311 --> 00:03:35,978
You're getting
close to him for a reason.

80
00:03:36,046 --> 00:03:36,979
Don't forget it.

81
00:03:37,047 --> 00:03:38,147
I haven't.

82
00:03:38,215 --> 00:03:39,482
And I don't think Amenadiel

83
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:41,083
is the one weaponizing Chloe.

84
00:03:41,151 --> 00:03:42,385
You don't think?

85
00:03:42,452 --> 00:03:44,353
Game's too dangerous to be guessing.

86
00:03:44,421 --> 00:03:46,355
I think it's time to send

87
00:03:46,423 --> 00:03:48,691
my brother back to high Heaven.

88
00:03:50,127 --> 00:03:53,562
Forcibly, if necessary.

89
00:03:57,434 --> 00:03:59,902
(shouts, grunting)

90
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:00,970
(laughing)

91
00:04:01,037 --> 00:04:03,072
See, there is something else.

92
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,908
It seems Italian
marble is also a threat, so...

93
00:04:05,976 --> 00:04:08,077
(doors opening)

94
00:04:08,145 --> 00:04:09,545
Oh.

95
00:04:09,613 --> 00:04:10,780
Detective?

96
00:04:10,847 --> 00:04:12,014
What a surprise.

97
00:04:12,082 --> 00:04:13,449
Where have you been?

98
00:04:13,517 --> 00:04:14,717
Ah, you know me... busy, busy.

99
00:04:14,751 --> 00:04:16,585
- No rest for the wicked.
- Right.

100
00:04:16,653 --> 00:04:19,789
'Cause deviant foreplay
is so time-consuming.

101
00:04:19,856 --> 00:04:20,990
Want to watch?

102
00:04:21,057 --> 00:04:22,057
I've been calling you

103
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,459
for three weeks.

104
00:04:23,527 --> 00:04:25,428
Why are you avoiding me?

105
00:04:25,495 --> 00:04:27,534
Well, I do have a
business to run, Detective.

106
00:04:27,535 --> 00:04:29,031
I can't play Good Cop/Handsome Devil Cop

107
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:30,633
all the time.

108
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,835
I've got a case that
I can't do without you.

109
00:04:32,903 --> 00:04:35,404
Really? (stammers)

110
00:04:35,472 --> 00:04:37,506
What's so special about it?

111
00:04:38,642 --> 00:04:41,277
You just have to see for yourself.

112
00:04:41,344 --> 00:04:43,746
Right.

113
00:04:43,814 --> 00:04:45,314
 Ah, ah 

114
00:04:45,382 --> 00:04:47,049
 Oh, no 

115
00:04:47,117 --> 00:04:48,717
 Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah 

116
00:04:48,785 --> 00:04:50,052
 Oh, no 

117
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,454
- (sirens wailing)
-  Ah, ah 

118
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:52,588
- (protestors chanting)
-  Oh, no 

119
00:04:52,656 --> 00:04:55,324
 No, she don't mess around 

120
00:04:55,392 --> 00:04:57,126
 No, she don't mess around... 

121
00:04:57,194 --> 00:04:58,427
We don't know a lot yet,

122
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,162
but we found the victim's purse

123
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,510
in a Dumpster behind the theater.

124
00:05:01,531 --> 00:05:03,165
Her name's Rose Davis.

125
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:05,267
She's 19 and...

126
00:05:05,335 --> 00:05:07,269
What are you doing back there?

127
00:05:07,337 --> 00:05:08,871
Just listening to your boring facts.

128
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:11,407
She's a freshman at
Pasadena City College, lives in Arca...

129
00:05:11,475 --> 00:05:12,708
Yeah, excuse me,
Detective, I'm not hearing

130
00:05:12,776 --> 00:05:14,844
any reasons to why you
need me on this case.

131
00:05:14,911 --> 00:05:16,278
I don't know how you
can hear anything...

132
00:05:16,346 --> 00:05:17,680
you're standing five feet away from me.

133
00:05:17,747 --> 00:05:18,681
Get over here.

134
00:05:18,748 --> 00:05:19,482
You sound phlegmy.

135
00:05:19,549 --> 00:05:20,683
I don't want to get sick.

136
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,984
Really? Let's go.

137
00:05:22,052 --> 00:05:24,420
PROTESTORS (chanting): Satan
is here, but God is near!

138
00:05:24,488 --> 00:05:26,689
Satan is here, but God
is near! Satan is here...

139
00:05:26,756 --> 00:05:28,824
You.

140
00:05:28,892 --> 00:05:30,559
Evil is here.

141
00:05:30,627 --> 00:05:32,528
Evil is here.

142
00:05:32,596 --> 00:05:34,797
PROTESTORS (chanting): Satan
is here, but God is near!

143
00:05:34,865 --> 00:05:36,065
Friend of yours?

144
00:05:36,132 --> 00:05:38,133
- Satan is here, but God is near!
- I meet a lot of people.

145
00:05:38,201 --> 00:05:39,702
Satan is here, but God...

146
00:05:39,769 --> 00:05:41,704
Take the sheet off.

147
00:05:46,276 --> 00:05:48,010
(camera shutter clicking)

148
00:05:48,078 --> 00:05:50,446
Oh, well.

149
00:05:50,514 --> 00:05:51,881
That is unfortunate.

150
00:05:51,948 --> 00:05:56,051
But I still don't understand
why you need me on this case.

151
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:57,786
Roll her over.

152
00:06:01,258 --> 00:06:02,825
That's why.

153
00:06:02,893 --> 00:06:04,527
LUCIFER: "Hail Lucifer"?

154
00:06:04,594 --> 00:06:07,596
(camera shutter clicking)

155
00:06:07,664 --> 00:06:14,643

156
00:06:19,516 --> 00:06:22,218
This is sickening.

157
00:06:22,285 --> 00:06:23,419
I know.

158
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,587
It's horrific.

159
00:06:24,654 --> 00:06:26,522
No, I mean, to blame it on me.

160
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,190
It's an atrocity.

161
00:06:28,258 --> 00:06:29,959
These Satanists.

162
00:06:30,026 --> 00:06:31,694
Misguided cult nobheads

163
00:06:31,762 --> 00:06:33,295
with Frisbees in their earlobes.

164
00:06:33,363 --> 00:06:34,563
This poor girl's death

165
00:06:34,631 --> 00:06:36,465
has nothing to do with me, Detective.

166
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:38,000
MAN: This is your
doing! This is your fault!

167
00:06:38,068 --> 00:06:39,468
You, what are you doing in here?

168
00:06:39,536 --> 00:06:40,569
You're the Devil!

169
00:06:40,637 --> 00:06:42,371
You're the King of All Evil!

170
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:44,473
You're the King of All Lies!

171
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:45,674
You must be destroyed!

172
00:06:45,742 --> 00:06:46,876
I'm gonna give you what for

173
00:06:46,943 --> 00:06:48,244
if you don't get out of
my crime scene, pal.

174
00:06:48,311 --> 00:06:49,411
Who let this guy through?

175
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:50,613
He's the Devil!

176
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,248
I'll rise again against you!

177
00:06:52,315 --> 00:06:54,850
No thanks necessary.

178
00:06:54,918 --> 00:06:58,454
Just wanted to do my
part for the man of the hour.

179
00:06:58,522 --> 00:06:59,882
It's the wink with the porn stache

180
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,657
sending the wrong message, I think.

181
00:07:01,725 --> 00:07:02,591
(laughs)

182
00:07:02,659 --> 00:07:03,559
Do you two know each other?

183
00:07:03,627 --> 00:07:05,861
Nope, just heard a lot about this guy.

184
00:07:05,929 --> 00:07:06,962
All bad, of course.

185
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,331
Detective Malcolm Graham.

186
00:07:11,368 --> 00:07:13,435
I wasn't gonna tell
her we're already buddies.

187
00:07:13,503 --> 00:07:16,038
You know, me trying to kill you,

188
00:07:16,106 --> 00:07:17,540
the whole magic coin thing.

189
00:07:17,607 --> 00:07:18,808
TMI... am I right?

190
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:21,143
I'd like you to stop touching me now.

191
00:07:21,211 --> 00:07:22,578
(laughs)

192
00:07:22,646 --> 00:07:24,446
Ah, you're hilarious.

193
00:07:24,514 --> 00:07:26,448
We should get a drink sometime.

194
00:07:26,516 --> 00:07:28,617
Yeah, maybe play some pool, huh?

195
00:07:34,891 --> 00:07:36,525
Hey, Chloe?

196
00:07:36,593 --> 00:07:38,694
If, uh, if we could talk soon,

197
00:07:38,762 --> 00:07:40,329
some stuff went down with Malcolm.

198
00:07:40,397 --> 00:07:41,931
I mean, I know now's a bad time...

199
00:07:41,998 --> 00:07:44,033
Yeah, it is.

200
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,569
This bruising here around
the stab wounds.

201
00:07:46,636 --> 00:07:47,903
DAN: Hilt marks maybe.

202
00:07:47,971 --> 00:07:49,205
And these.

203
00:07:49,272 --> 00:07:51,073
There's subdermal implants.

204
00:07:51,141 --> 00:07:52,508
They don't look fresh.

205
00:07:52,576 --> 00:07:53,709
I don't know what they are.

206
00:07:53,777 --> 00:07:55,578
Symbols? Designs maybe?

207
00:07:55,645 --> 00:07:57,746
Well, not a lot of places do that
kind of body modification.

208
00:07:57,814 --> 00:08:00,382
Malcolm and I will try
to find who put them in.

209
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,684
All right.

210
00:08:01,751 --> 00:08:04,320
He and I have to meet Rose's
father at her apartment.

211
00:08:04,387 --> 00:08:06,021
Right, where is that exactly?

212
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:09,024
Uh, 1625 Lynrose.

213
00:08:09,092 --> 00:08:10,426
Right, I'll see you there.

214
00:08:10,493 --> 00:08:12,094
What? What-what are you doing?

215
00:08:12,162 --> 00:08:13,329
I'm gonna take my own ride.

216
00:08:13,396 --> 00:08:14,830
You're a wretched driver.

217
00:08:14,898 --> 00:08:16,398
Since when?

218
00:08:16,466 --> 00:08:20,836
 It's colder now than it was 

219
00:08:20,904 --> 00:08:23,405
 Yesterday 

220
00:08:23,473 --> 00:08:25,674
 Warm down south 

221
00:08:25,742 --> 00:08:27,109
 So I'm on my way... 

222
00:08:27,177 --> 00:08:28,544
I'm so sorry for your loss.

223
00:08:28,612 --> 00:08:30,063
Were you close with your daughter?

224
00:08:30,088 --> 00:08:30,588
Yes.

225
00:08:30,614 --> 00:08:33,415
Well, we were when she was little, but

226
00:08:33,483 --> 00:08:35,551
you know, single father
with a teenage daughter...

227
00:08:35,619 --> 00:08:38,687
Yes, I'm quite familiar
with the absentee father

228
00:08:38,755 --> 00:08:39,822
excuses.

229
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,790
Can you tell us why
Rose marred herself recently

230
00:08:41,858 --> 00:08:44,026
with subdermal implants?
- What?

231
00:08:44,094 --> 00:08:45,728
That doesn't sound like Rosie.

232
00:08:45,795 --> 00:08:49,365
This bookshelf's been moved a lot.

233
00:08:54,537 --> 00:08:56,605
(hinges creaking)

234
00:08:59,342 --> 00:09:01,443
Oh, lovely.

235
00:09:01,511 --> 00:09:04,713
Very mid-century rapist.

236
00:09:06,082 --> 00:09:08,017
Hello, bad guys?

237
00:09:22,599 --> 00:09:24,733
What is this place?

238
00:09:26,569 --> 00:09:28,671
It's a creepy, secret evil room.

239
00:09:28,738 --> 00:09:30,172
You didn't know about this?

240
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,408
No.

241
00:09:36,813 --> 00:09:38,180
What's this?

242
00:09:38,248 --> 00:09:40,349
It's a chicken.

243
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:41,817
Or what's left of it.

244
00:09:41,885 --> 00:09:43,752
If that's supposed to
be an offering for me,

245
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,622
then I decline on grounds of salmonella.

246
00:09:49,225 --> 00:09:50,759
This picture, th...

247
00:09:50,827 --> 00:09:52,962
this isn't Rose.

248
00:09:54,965 --> 00:09:56,532
Mr. Davis, I'm so sorry.

249
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:58,734
But maybe this wasn't a random attack.

250
00:09:58,802 --> 00:10:01,236
Maybe your daughter was
involved with whoever killed her.

251
00:10:01,304 --> 00:10:02,905
It's a large man by the looks of it,

252
00:10:02,973 --> 00:10:06,608
who's, uh, not a fan of bathing.

253
00:10:06,676 --> 00:10:08,210
MR. DAVIS: This is crazy.

254
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:10,746
I mean, even if she was into
this stupid Devil thing,

255
00:10:10,814 --> 00:10:12,748
she wouldn't have sacrificed herself.

256
00:10:12,816 --> 00:10:15,217
Yes, but sometimes the people
closest to you can turn on you.

257
00:10:15,285 --> 00:10:17,119
Wouldn't you agree, Detective?

258
00:10:17,187 --> 00:10:19,655
Maybe.

259
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,993
"For my Corazon.

260
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:24,793
Love, Rose."

261
00:10:24,861 --> 00:10:25,861
"Corazon" is Spanish for heart.

262
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:28,464
Could be a term of endearment.

263
00:10:28,531 --> 00:10:30,466
Could be a name.

264
00:10:30,533 --> 00:10:34,236
MR. DAVIS: I should've reached out.

265
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:36,605
Called more.

266
00:10:36,673 --> 00:10:38,774
I thought I knew her.

267
00:10:38,842 --> 00:10:42,911
Oh, yes, I know exactly how you feel.

268
00:10:42,979 --> 00:10:44,913
(phone rings)

269
00:10:47,417 --> 00:10:48,784
Decker.

270
00:10:48,852 --> 00:10:51,887
We called around, found the
girl that gave Rose her subdermals.

271
00:10:51,955 --> 00:10:54,690
Said she, uh, came in a couple
weeks ago with a guy.

272
00:10:54,758 --> 00:10:56,625
Weird guy, apparently,
with a weird name, too,

273
00:10:56,693 --> 00:10:58,227
but she can't remember it.

274
00:10:58,294 --> 00:10:59,828
Ask if the name's Corazon.

275
00:10:59,896 --> 00:11:03,165
Hey. Was the guy's name Corazon?

276
00:11:03,233 --> 00:11:04,566
Yeah, that's it.

277
00:11:04,634 --> 00:11:06,769
Uh, jet black hair, lots
of piercings and tattoos.

278
00:11:08,104 --> 00:11:09,938
Did you hear that?

279
00:11:10,006 --> 00:11:11,206
Yeah, generic Satanist.

280
00:11:11,274 --> 00:11:13,642
What about the, uh,
subdermals... she know what they mean?

281
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,676
No.

282
00:11:14,744 --> 00:11:16,278
Says Rose brought them in herself.

283
00:11:16,346 --> 00:11:18,313
She was super secretive about 'em.

284
00:11:18,381 --> 00:11:19,448
Uh-huh.

285
00:11:19,516 --> 00:11:21,350
We'll talk soon.

286
00:11:21,418 --> 00:11:23,352
- Ah, look at you two.
- (sighs)

287
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,686
Marriage falling apart,

288
00:11:24,754 --> 00:11:26,155
trying to work together...

289
00:11:26,222 --> 00:11:27,723
So cute.

290
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,458
Yeah, well, maybe if you
hadn't sent her a break-up text

291
00:11:29,526 --> 00:11:31,326
- while I was unconscious...
- Oh.

292
00:11:31,394 --> 00:11:32,995
Hey, speaking of

293
00:11:33,063 --> 00:11:35,531
kicking your ass, I'm
proud of you for bouncing back.

294
00:11:35,598 --> 00:11:37,299
Friends fight, right?

295
00:11:37,367 --> 00:11:38,801
Yeah.

296
00:11:38,868 --> 00:11:40,602
Dick.

297
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,805
(distant siren wailing)

298
00:11:45,141 --> 00:11:46,842
(alarm chirps)

299
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,646
(growling)

300
00:11:50,713 --> 00:11:51,847
(grunts)

301
00:11:53,483 --> 00:11:55,084
Why is Lucifer still alive?

302
00:11:55,151 --> 00:11:56,018
Oh, it's you.

303
00:11:56,086 --> 00:11:57,119
You scared me, dude.

304
00:11:57,187 --> 00:11:58,554
Have you forgotten what
will happen to you

305
00:11:58,621 --> 00:12:00,022
if you don't comply with our deal?

306
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:03,025
No, but I forgot to tell you!

307
00:12:03,093 --> 00:12:04,960
Lucifer spilled the beans.

308
00:12:07,885 --> 00:12:09,498
What are you talking about?

309
00:12:09,566 --> 00:12:10,566
All that jazz about

310
00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:12,601
condemning me to eternal damnation?

311
00:12:12,669 --> 00:12:14,269
Poppycock, apparently.

312
00:12:14,337 --> 00:12:16,071
You're an angel

313
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:18,807
and Lucifer said that you're
not allowed to kill me.

314
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,709
Plus...

315
00:12:20,777 --> 00:12:22,578
I got this beauty right here.

316
00:12:22,645 --> 00:12:25,080
It's my get-out-of-Hell-free card.

317
00:12:25,148 --> 00:12:27,082
(growls)

318
00:12:28,685 --> 00:12:31,153
(sighs)

319
00:12:31,221 --> 00:12:32,721
So...

320
00:12:32,789 --> 00:12:36,091
unless you got a better offer...

321
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:40,062
#TeamLucifer.

322
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,364
It's not half bad, this.

323
00:12:42,432 --> 00:12:44,166
I mean, the writing's atrocious,

324
00:12:44,234 --> 00:12:45,934
but it's not complete drivel.

325
00:12:46,002 --> 00:12:47,035
Listen to this:

326
00:12:47,103 --> 00:12:49,605
"Satan represents a beacon of honesty

327
00:12:49,672 --> 00:12:53,075
in a sea of mass self-deceit."

328
00:12:53,143 --> 00:12:54,076
Mmm.

329
00:12:54,144 --> 00:12:55,277
And... oh. Hello.

330
00:12:55,345 --> 00:12:57,168
There's a whole chapter on sex.

331
00:12:57,169 --> 00:12:58,522
I like this book.

332
00:12:58,615 --> 00:13:01,183
Rose's subdermal implants...

333
00:13:01,251 --> 00:13:03,418
I'm pretty sure they're letters.

334
00:13:03,486 --> 00:13:06,121
But I've arranged
them 100 different ways

335
00:13:06,189 --> 00:13:08,891
and I can't come up with
anything significant.

336
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:12,327
"Chili furis"?

337
00:13:12,395 --> 00:13:16,365
"I hurl ficis"?

338
00:13:18,067 --> 00:13:19,768
No.

339
00:13:19,836 --> 00:13:22,504
But could... could
you come over here, please?

340
00:13:30,446 --> 00:13:32,548
Oh, bloody hell.

341
00:13:34,951 --> 00:13:36,518
Filii hircus. It's Latin.

342
00:13:36,586 --> 00:13:37,619
Means "children of the goat."

343
00:13:37,687 --> 00:13:39,555
Why do they always associate
me with goats?

344
00:13:39,622 --> 00:13:41,182
I mean, I don't even like their cheese.

345
00:13:42,392 --> 00:13:43,625
Here we go.

346
00:13:43,693 --> 00:13:45,093
"Church of the Dark Prince."

347
00:13:48,698 --> 00:13:49,998
Location is secret.

348
00:13:50,066 --> 00:13:52,501
Looks like you have to be a member.

349
00:13:52,569 --> 00:13:55,871
Geez, look at this questionnaire.

350
00:13:55,939 --> 00:13:57,506
Oh, and of course,

351
00:13:57,574 --> 00:13:59,007
there's a fee.

352
00:13:59,075 --> 00:14:00,609
$200? Sinful.

353
00:14:00,677 --> 00:14:03,111
There's got to be a faster way.

354
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:06,315
LUCIFER: "What is
your gift to the Devil?"

355
00:14:06,382 --> 00:14:09,618
CHLOE: How about... filii hircus?

356
00:14:09,686 --> 00:14:11,119
Yes!

357
00:14:11,187 --> 00:14:12,354
(mumbling to self)

358
00:14:13,856 --> 00:14:15,691
All right. Okay... what...

359
00:14:15,758 --> 00:14:17,893
Yeah, I'll see you there!

360
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:20,929
What...?

361
00:14:20,997 --> 00:14:23,465
 

362
00:14:33,243 --> 00:14:34,409
(clears throat)

363
00:14:37,146 --> 00:14:38,280
Okay.

364
00:14:38,348 --> 00:14:40,349
That's it.

365
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,450
You're being a freak.

366
00:14:41,517 --> 00:14:43,719
You've been avoiding me for weeks,

367
00:14:43,786 --> 00:14:45,187
you won't get in my car.

368
00:14:45,255 --> 00:14:46,421
What's your problem?

369
00:14:46,489 --> 00:14:47,456
There's no problem.

370
00:14:47,523 --> 00:14:48,924
Just maybe you're not as charming

371
00:14:48,992 --> 00:14:51,727
as you think you are.

372
00:14:51,794 --> 00:14:54,563
Wait, is this about that
vulnerability thing?

373
00:14:54,631 --> 00:14:56,598
Actually, yes.

374
00:14:58,301 --> 00:15:00,836
I mean... I get the teensiest
bit touchy-feely with you

375
00:15:00,903 --> 00:15:02,371
and you freak out.

376
00:15:02,438 --> 00:15:04,039
Ugh. All I meant that night

377
00:15:04,107 --> 00:15:05,707
is that I can trust you.

378
00:15:06,909 --> 00:15:08,176
That's all.

379
00:15:08,244 --> 00:15:09,177
Okay?

380
00:15:09,245 --> 00:15:10,145
Okay.

381
00:15:10,213 --> 00:15:11,380
Okay.

382
00:15:11,447 --> 00:15:12,347
Okay.

383
00:15:20,356 --> 00:15:22,090
(clears throat)

384
00:15:22,158 --> 00:15:24,593
(whispering) Filii hircus.

385
00:15:26,362 --> 00:15:27,763
(sighs)

386
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,997
Habeas corpus?

387
00:15:29,065 --> 00:15:30,299
Bababooey?

388
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:32,434
You had it right the first time.

389
00:15:32,502 --> 00:15:34,736
But today is private.

390
00:15:35,905 --> 00:15:39,274
Too private for Lucifer himself?

391
00:15:39,342 --> 00:15:40,475
You're supposed to be blond.

392
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,278
Yes, I get that a lot.

393
00:15:43,346 --> 00:15:45,414
- You have ID?
- Absolutely.

394
00:15:45,481 --> 00:15:47,082
Let me just, uh...

395
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,350
Oh. Dearie me.

396
00:15:48,418 --> 00:15:49,618
I seem to have left it in the car.

397
00:15:49,686 --> 00:15:51,486
Detective, would you mind
going to fetch it, please?

398
00:15:51,554 --> 00:15:53,504
What am I, your dog?

399
00:16:01,466 --> 00:16:02,657
Detective...

400
00:16:02,812 --> 00:16:04,195
After you.

401
00:16:13,512 --> 00:16:15,118
It's very Eyes Wide Shut.

402
00:16:15,254 --> 00:16:17,937
Too bad I forgot my sexy mask.

403
00:16:18,005 --> 00:16:20,206
Does anything scare you?

404
00:16:20,274 --> 00:16:21,474
Should it?

405
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:23,877
MAN: Rose is gone.

406
00:16:23,944 --> 00:16:25,712
But it is not her
death that was important,

407
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:27,013
it was her life.

408
00:16:27,081 --> 00:16:29,048
The imprint she left behind.

409
00:16:29,116 --> 00:16:31,818
See, Rose will be remembered.

410
00:16:31,886 --> 00:16:33,920
She will live on forever.

411
00:16:33,988 --> 00:16:36,189
This isn't a sacrifice.

412
00:16:36,257 --> 00:16:37,323
It's a memorial.

413
00:16:37,391 --> 00:16:38,791
Quite civilized, actually.

414
00:16:38,859 --> 00:16:41,436
Yeah, they don't seem like killers.

415
00:16:41,461 --> 00:16:42,319
Mmm.

416
00:16:42,363 --> 00:16:43,763
ONYX: And so now

417
00:16:43,831 --> 00:16:46,399
it is time to invoke

418
00:16:46,467 --> 00:16:48,701
the Four Crowned Princes of Hell.

419
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:50,270
Oh. Scratch that.

420
00:16:50,337 --> 00:16:52,305
Visualize the blue light

421
00:16:52,373 --> 00:16:54,307
filling your entire being.

422
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,910
Satan to the east.

423
00:16:56,977 --> 00:16:58,811
Beelzebub to the north...

424
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,180
This is preposterous.

425
00:17:00,247 --> 00:17:02,315
I thought you'd love this.

426
00:17:02,383 --> 00:17:03,750
First of all, there's only one me.

427
00:17:03,817 --> 00:17:06,152
And secondly, the whole
worship thing is more my father's bag.

428
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,621
And now...

429
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:11,558
Lucifer will speak!

430
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:12,559
What?

431
00:17:15,729 --> 00:17:17,096
- (thump)
- Ooh.

432
00:17:17,164 --> 00:17:19,132
Oh. No. No, no, no, no, no.

433
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,576
This is where I draw the line.

434
00:17:20,601 --> 00:17:21,059
Ow.

435
00:17:21,101 --> 00:17:23,536
- Ow.
- Excuse me, excuse me! Sorry.

436
00:17:23,604 --> 00:17:24,737
Sorry.

437
00:17:24,805 --> 00:17:25,772
MAN: Hey, man.

438
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,373
If you would just butt out.

439
00:17:27,441 --> 00:17:28,174
Right!

440
00:17:28,242 --> 00:17:29,742
I'm the real Lucifer

441
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:32,979
and I insist that you
stop this nonsense immediately.

442
00:17:33,047 --> 00:17:34,407
I mean, have you heard yourselves?

443
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,205
It's embarrassing.

444
00:17:35,249 --> 00:17:36,926
Blue light coming out your ass

445
00:17:36,927 --> 00:17:37,826
or whatever it was.

446
00:17:37,977 --> 00:17:39,986
I mean, you preach rebellion,

447
00:17:40,054 --> 00:17:41,721
but you're-you're misguided sheep.

448
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:43,289
And goat.

449
00:17:43,357 --> 00:17:44,958
Where's the real defiance?

450
00:17:45,025 --> 00:17:46,593
- The free will?
- SATANIST: Yeah!

451
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,594
Free will!

452
00:17:47,661 --> 00:17:48,695
Free will rules!

453
00:17:48,762 --> 00:17:50,063
(applause)

454
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,965
No, no! You're doing it again.

455
00:17:52,032 --> 00:17:53,266
Don't applaud.

456
00:17:53,334 --> 00:17:54,867
This whole thing's a sham!

457
00:17:54,935 --> 00:17:55,868
(woman whoops)

458
00:17:55,936 --> 00:17:57,136
Anarchy!

459
00:17:57,204 --> 00:17:58,137
(cheering, whooping)

460
00:17:58,205 --> 00:17:59,372
I mean, just-just look at this.

461
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,241
What is this supposed to be?

462
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,477
Alien fetus?

463
00:18:04,545 --> 00:18:06,112
Pickled demon?

464
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,214
He's the best
Lucifer we've had in years.

465
00:18:08,282 --> 00:18:11,284
(chanting) Lucifer! Lucifer!

466
00:18:11,352 --> 00:18:13,286
- Lucifer...
- Stop!

467
00:18:14,822 --> 00:18:16,789
Someone killed this girl!

468
00:18:16,857 --> 00:18:18,191
She didn't deserve that.

469
00:18:18,259 --> 00:18:20,460
This is not what I stand for.

470
00:18:20,527 --> 00:18:23,496
Is that what you all wanted? Eh?

471
00:18:27,468 --> 00:18:30,370
Should be ashamed of yourselves.

472
00:18:34,942 --> 00:18:35,908
LAPD.

473
00:18:35,976 --> 00:18:37,610
Put the knife down.

474
00:18:41,215 --> 00:18:43,349
Why were you running?

475
00:18:44,218 --> 00:18:45,652
I wasn't.

476
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:46,653
I was upset.

477
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,021
Feeling guilty, are you?

478
00:18:48,088 --> 00:18:49,188
Tell me... why?

479
00:18:49,256 --> 00:18:51,691
What, our new Devil's a cop, now, is he?

480
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:53,459
LUCIFER: Oh, worse
than that, I'm afraid.

481
00:18:53,527 --> 00:18:54,427
So come on.

482
00:18:54,495 --> 00:18:56,195
Tell me, what nasty little urge

483
00:18:56,263 --> 00:18:58,564
are you hiding in your hoodie, hmm?

484
00:19:01,068 --> 00:19:02,368
I want to kill...

485
00:19:02,436 --> 00:19:03,503
Yeah?

486
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:06,773
I want to kill the sick
bastard who killed Rose.

487
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,007
And then, after that,

488
00:19:08,075 --> 00:19:11,477
I want the hell out of this racket.

489
00:19:11,545 --> 00:19:13,713
Oh.

490
00:19:13,781 --> 00:19:15,548
What's your name?

491
00:19:15,616 --> 00:19:16,649
Onyx.

492
00:19:16,717 --> 00:19:17,717
Hmm?

493
00:19:17,785 --> 00:19:19,118
(sighs)

494
00:19:19,186 --> 00:19:21,154
Mitch Watson.

495
00:19:21,221 --> 00:19:23,089
Yeah, I changed it when
I joined the church.

496
00:19:23,157 --> 00:19:26,592
12 years later, I'm the
frickin' high priest.

497
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,593
I'd love to bail.

498
00:19:27,661 --> 00:19:29,462
Kind of late for a
career change, though.

499
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:32,165
I mean, the whole thing's a joke.

500
00:19:32,232 --> 00:19:33,666
So, hold on...

501
00:19:33,734 --> 00:19:35,802
Are you saying you
don't believe in Lucifer?

502
00:19:35,869 --> 00:19:38,438
Look, mate, the Devil ain't
gonna buy me an Aston Martin.

503
00:19:38,505 --> 00:19:40,065
Well, not with that attitude, he won't.

504
00:19:40,107 --> 00:19:42,075
I mean, I like the philosophy.

505
00:19:42,142 --> 00:19:43,776
But it attracts a lot of weirdoes

506
00:19:43,844 --> 00:19:45,545
who take it way too seriously.

507
00:19:45,612 --> 00:19:46,813
And, of course,

508
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,414
now Rosie's dead.

509
00:19:48,482 --> 00:19:49,942
Yeah, and I see you have the same

510
00:19:49,967 --> 00:19:51,341
subdermal implants as she did.

511
00:19:51,385 --> 00:19:52,652
All the hard core members...

512
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,786
they all get this.

513
00:19:53,854 --> 00:19:54,921
I was trying to tell Rosie

514
00:19:54,988 --> 00:19:56,356
that she would regret it later,

515
00:19:56,423 --> 00:19:58,858
but she became obsessed.

516
00:19:58,926 --> 00:20:00,560
She was an impressionable girl.

517
00:20:00,627 --> 00:20:02,161
Well, her father was absentee.

518
00:20:02,229 --> 00:20:04,831
I suppose that's why she got
involved in all this nonsense,

519
00:20:04,898 --> 00:20:06,232
to piss her dad off.

520
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,201
Actually, it was,
uh... it was her boyfriend,

521
00:20:08,268 --> 00:20:10,069
Corazon, he's the
one who brought her in.

522
00:20:10,137 --> 00:20:12,038
Man, the guy's a creeper.

523
00:20:12,106 --> 00:20:14,841
He kept talking about
doing real sacrifices on animals.

524
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,111
Did Corazon have access to this knife?

525
00:20:18,178 --> 00:20:20,346
Yeah, probably.

526
00:20:21,348 --> 00:20:23,649
This here is just for show.

527
00:20:23,717 --> 00:20:26,853
The blade springs inside the handle.

528
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,321
Hmm. Strange.

529
00:20:28,389 --> 00:20:30,523
'Cause if it was
real... it could definitely match

530
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,991
the marks found on Rose's body.

531
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:33,726
We do have an actual version.

532
00:20:33,794 --> 00:20:34,727
Hold on.

533
00:20:38,932 --> 00:20:40,366
Knife's gone.

534
00:20:40,434 --> 00:20:41,868
Okay, we need to find Corazon now.

535
00:20:41,935 --> 00:20:42,969
- Yeah.
- Do you have, um,

536
00:20:43,036 --> 00:20:44,237
his real name,

537
00:20:44,304 --> 00:20:46,005
uh, where he lives, his address?

538
00:20:46,073 --> 00:20:47,373
Give me a sec.

539
00:20:50,711 --> 00:20:52,311
Ugh.

540
00:20:55,182 --> 00:20:56,616
Looks just like you.

541
00:20:56,683 --> 00:20:58,184
I manscape.

542
00:20:59,653 --> 00:21:02,955
I'm starting to understand
why you chose this persona.

543
00:21:03,023 --> 00:21:04,957
All-powerful...

544
00:21:05,025 --> 00:21:06,092
Invincible...

545
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,527
Not exactly.

546
00:21:08,962 --> 00:21:12,965
Ah. Or it's because you think that
everybody's out to get you.

547
00:21:13,033 --> 00:21:14,066
That's because they are.

548
00:21:14,134 --> 00:21:15,802
But trust me, I didn't choose it.

549
00:21:15,869 --> 00:21:17,870
Why would anyone choose to be vilified?

550
00:21:17,938 --> 00:21:20,072
Thought the Devil was
supposed to be immortal.

551
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,275
Well, one angel can hurt another, so...

552
00:21:28,248 --> 00:21:29,882
Oh, what...?

553
00:21:31,251 --> 00:21:32,819
What are you doing?

554
00:21:32,886 --> 00:21:34,454
(door opens)

555
00:21:34,521 --> 00:21:38,020
No address, no last name, nothing.

556
00:21:38,859 --> 00:21:39,759
Hmm.

557
00:21:39,827 --> 00:21:42,128
He used PayPal to pay for the fee.

558
00:21:42,196 --> 00:21:44,430
All right, I'll call in a warrant.

559
00:21:49,736 --> 00:21:52,805
Well, if you can't
bring Muhammad to the dim sum...

560
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,914
Hey.

561
00:22:01,982 --> 00:22:03,649
Why'd you stand me up?

562
00:22:03,717 --> 00:22:05,918
I had one task...

563
00:22:05,986 --> 00:22:08,454
one...

564
00:22:08,522 --> 00:22:10,790
to get my brother back to Hell.

565
00:22:15,829 --> 00:22:17,563
I've not only failed,

566
00:22:17,631 --> 00:22:20,399
but I've actually made things worse.

567
00:22:20,467 --> 00:22:22,869
I'm even sleeping with a demon.

568
00:22:26,073 --> 00:22:28,274
Yeah, you lucky son of a bitch.

569
00:22:28,342 --> 00:22:32,345
Come on, you can't say

570
00:22:32,412 --> 00:22:36,616
that this isn't the
best sex you've ever had.

571
00:22:36,683 --> 00:22:39,085
Well, it is the only sex you've
ever had, but still.

572
00:22:39,152 --> 00:22:41,087
(chuckles)

573
00:22:41,154 --> 00:22:44,891
Look, I've had a lot of sex,

574
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:48,160
with men and women.

575
00:22:48,228 --> 00:22:49,896
- I mean a lot.
- Okay.

576
00:22:49,963 --> 00:22:51,297
Point made.

577
00:22:51,365 --> 00:22:54,834
But this, with you,

578
00:22:54,902 --> 00:22:56,302
I don't know, it's...

579
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,838
it's different.

580
00:23:08,448 --> 00:23:11,384
But if you're not happy here,

581
00:23:11,451 --> 00:23:13,586
then you should go home.

582
00:23:13,654 --> 00:23:16,689
I can't.

583
00:23:16,757 --> 00:23:21,027
I can't face my father as a failure.

584
00:23:21,094 --> 00:23:23,029
Look, I have a job to do.

585
00:23:23,096 --> 00:23:25,264
There's no choice.

586
00:23:25,332 --> 00:23:28,367
I understand.

587
00:23:37,411 --> 00:23:39,078
<i>CHLOE: Okay. Great.</i>

588
00:23:39,146 --> 00:23:40,346
Yeah, I'll be here.

589
00:23:40,414 --> 00:23:41,614
All right.

590
00:23:41,682 --> 00:23:43,683
So we got a real name for Corazon...

591
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,718
Mike Carey... but it
could take us a while to find him,

592
00:23:45,786 --> 00:23:47,187
so you should probably head home.

593
00:23:47,212 --> 00:23:47,911
Oh, no, no, no.

594
00:23:47,955 --> 00:23:50,089
Not till this human
stain's brought to justice.

595
00:23:50,157 --> 00:23:52,291
(scoffs) I can't get near you,

596
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:54,026
now I can't get rid of you.

597
00:23:54,094 --> 00:23:55,027
Whatever.

598
00:23:55,095 --> 00:23:56,295
I'm gonna go up and shower.

599
00:23:56,363 --> 00:23:57,964
Stay put. Do not wake up Trixie.

600
00:24:00,701 --> 00:24:02,635
 

601
00:24:07,975 --> 00:24:09,875
(sighs)

602
00:24:18,251 --> 00:24:20,953
Did you just throw a toy at me?

603
00:24:21,021 --> 00:24:22,221
Oh, you're awake.

604
00:24:22,289 --> 00:24:24,190
But since you're up, I
have some questions for you.

605
00:24:24,257 --> 00:24:25,758
Right.

606
00:24:25,826 --> 00:24:27,860
Are you adopted?

607
00:24:27,928 --> 00:24:31,030
In other words, are you sure
the detective is your mother?

608
00:24:31,098 --> 00:24:32,665
Could she be from somewhere else?

609
00:24:32,733 --> 00:24:34,600
Does she have any special powers?

610
00:24:34,668 --> 00:24:37,136
Uh-uh. What about any markings?

611
00:24:37,204 --> 00:24:39,939
Scars, on her back perhaps?

612
00:24:40,007 --> 00:24:42,274
There's some chocolate
cake in it for you.

613
00:24:42,342 --> 00:24:44,076
I want cash.

614
00:24:44,144 --> 00:24:45,578
Oh.

615
00:24:45,646 --> 00:24:48,814
(chuckles) I like your style.

616
00:24:48,882 --> 00:24:50,750
All right.

617
00:24:50,817 --> 00:24:52,418
Mommy does have a scar.

618
00:24:52,486 --> 00:24:54,420
- Oh?
- On her butt.

619
00:24:54,488 --> 00:24:56,088
From when she got bit.

620
00:24:56,156 --> 00:24:57,556
By the Kraken.

621
00:24:57,624 --> 00:24:58,791
Right.

622
00:24:59,826 --> 00:25:01,260
Not the direction I was going for,

623
00:25:01,328 --> 00:25:03,362
but what's this Kraken that you talk of?

624
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:06,132
CHLOE: My mom's evil Chihuahua.

625
00:25:06,199 --> 00:25:07,400
Why aren't you showering?

626
00:25:07,467 --> 00:25:08,868
'Cause I left my phone down here.

627
00:25:08,935 --> 00:25:10,136
Why is Trixie awake?

628
00:25:10,203 --> 00:25:12,838
- (snaps)
- Get back in bed, young lady.

629
00:25:12,906 --> 00:25:13,873
Night, Lucifer.

630
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,842
All right, seriously.

631
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:19,078
No more freaky behavior.

632
00:25:19,146 --> 00:25:21,213
If this is about the
other night, I'm sorry, okay?

633
00:25:21,281 --> 00:25:23,056
What do you want me to
do, take it all back?

634
00:25:23,057 --> 00:25:25,051
No, can you take your shirt off, please?

635
00:25:25,118 --> 00:25:26,018
What?

636
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,454
Are you serious?

637
00:25:28,522 --> 00:25:29,822
I need to see your back.

638
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:31,223
Why?

639
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:34,727
Because I want to know if
you're an angel sent to destroy me.

640
00:25:40,167 --> 00:25:41,567
(sighs)

641
00:25:44,371 --> 00:25:46,572
Nothing.

642
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,641
Yeah.

643
00:25:48,709 --> 00:25:50,710
Is this about the scars on your back?

644
00:25:50,777 --> 00:25:54,914
Look, I have no
idea what happened to you

645
00:25:54,981 --> 00:25:56,449
or what's going on with you now,

646
00:25:56,516 --> 00:25:59,652
but... not everyone's out to get you.

647
00:26:01,121 --> 00:26:02,855
(phone buzzing)

648
00:26:02,923 --> 00:26:05,791
They found him... Corazon.

649
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,603
WOMAN: We found his car like this.

650
00:26:17,671 --> 00:26:19,805
It's registered to Mike Carey.

651
00:26:24,745 --> 00:26:26,612
- (clattering)
- (gasps)

652
00:26:29,516 --> 00:26:30,850
(Malcolm chuckles)

653
00:26:30,917 --> 00:26:32,852
Just like old times, huh?

654
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:34,220
Don't shoot me though.

655
00:26:34,287 --> 00:26:35,221
Funny.

656
00:26:35,288 --> 00:26:36,555
Come on, I'm just joking.

657
00:26:36,623 --> 00:26:37,990
(clattering)

658
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:43,896
Ah, Detective Douche, Detective Stache.

659
00:26:43,964 --> 00:26:45,097
What a pleasant surprise.

660
00:26:45,165 --> 00:26:46,232
Did you find anything?

661
00:26:46,299 --> 00:26:48,100
Place seems empty.

662
00:26:57,477 --> 00:27:00,579
CHLOE (whispering): My God.

663
00:27:15,453 --> 00:27:16,753
It's definitely Mike Carey.

664
00:27:16,821 --> 00:27:19,889
Detectives, can I show you something?

665
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,527
(siren wailing)

666
00:27:24,595 --> 00:27:26,763
So what do you really
make of all this, huh?

667
00:27:26,831 --> 00:27:28,965
The "Hail, Lucifer," the pentagram?

668
00:27:29,033 --> 00:27:33,737
I think it's a long time
since I encountered genuine evil.

669
00:27:33,804 --> 00:27:35,038
Wow.

670
00:27:38,943 --> 00:27:40,410
(sniffing)

671
00:27:40,478 --> 00:27:42,345
It's not blood. It's paint.

672
00:27:44,682 --> 00:27:46,783
So the killer strapped Mike up

673
00:27:46,851 --> 00:27:49,753
then decided to go all Jackson Pollock?

674
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,021
I guess.

675
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:55,525
Yeah, looks like an "A."

676
00:27:55,593 --> 00:27:56,993
That can't be random.

677
00:27:57,061 --> 00:27:58,728
I think it's a word.

678
00:28:07,972 --> 00:28:11,841
(gasps) Giant anamorphic print.

679
00:28:11,909 --> 00:28:13,843
"Morningstar."

680
00:28:13,911 --> 00:28:16,212
DAN: Whoa.

681
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,081
Another Satanic message.

682
00:28:18,149 --> 00:28:19,449
Or a fan letter.

683
00:28:19,517 --> 00:28:21,751
Morningstar is not exactly the
most common name for the Devil.

684
00:28:21,819 --> 00:28:24,454
You think someone
did this for our Lucifer?

685
00:28:24,522 --> 00:28:25,989
That's kind of a leap, Dan.

686
00:28:26,056 --> 00:28:28,725
Yeah, but if I'm right,
it's also a conflict of interest.

687
00:28:28,793 --> 00:28:30,860
Somebody could be
doing this on his behalf,

688
00:28:30,928 --> 00:28:32,595
or maybe he's
involved in a different way.

689
00:28:32,663 --> 00:28:34,397
- What does that mean?
- LUCIFER: Yes.

690
00:28:34,465 --> 00:28:36,866
What are you insinuating?

691
00:28:36,934 --> 00:28:38,401
That some psycho might be killing people

692
00:28:38,469 --> 00:28:39,936
because of your whole Devil shtick.

693
00:28:40,004 --> 00:28:41,504
You're blaming this nonsense on me?

694
00:28:41,572 --> 00:28:43,740
You do take the whole
Satan thing pretty seriously.

695
00:28:43,808 --> 00:28:45,675
You really think I'd
do these vile things?

696
00:28:45,743 --> 00:28:48,411
These kids were pretending to be bad,

697
00:28:48,479 --> 00:28:49,959
but they weren't, they were innocent,

698
00:28:50,014 --> 00:28:51,881
so I would never hurt
them, I'm not a monster.

699
00:28:51,949 --> 00:28:52,916
CHLOE: Okay, guys.

700
00:28:52,983 --> 00:28:54,517
That's enough.

701
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:59,022
Lucifer, maybe you should go home.

702
00:28:59,089 --> 00:29:02,492
Oh, no, allow me to stay in
this rusty tin can a little longer.

703
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,261
You came to me, you
insisted I work this case.

704
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:07,530
Okay, this sounds crazy,

705
00:29:07,598 --> 00:29:09,499
but this case might involve you.

706
00:29:09,567 --> 00:29:10,834
What do you mean, involve me?

707
00:29:10,901 --> 00:29:11,935
You know what I mean.

708
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:13,603
- (sighs)
- I'm trying to protect you.

709
00:29:13,671 --> 00:29:18,541
Oh, protect me from the
evil or the world from evil me?

710
00:29:25,916 --> 00:29:27,484
Can you believe Detective von Douche

711
00:29:27,551 --> 00:29:29,252
boots me off the case?

712
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,987
And Chloe agreed to this?

713
00:29:31,055 --> 00:29:32,388
(sighs) She didn't disagree.

714
00:29:32,456 --> 00:29:33,756
(chuckles incredulously)

715
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,725
How could she even think I'm capable?

716
00:29:35,793 --> 00:29:36,860
Here?

717
00:29:36,927 --> 00:29:39,062
That's why I left.

718
00:29:39,129 --> 00:29:40,530
I thought she knew me.

719
00:29:40,598 --> 00:29:41,798
I thought I knew her.

720
00:29:41,866 --> 00:29:43,466
And now you don't trust her anymore?

721
00:29:43,534 --> 00:29:46,936
Oh, it's just this
whole immortality thing.

722
00:29:47,004 --> 00:29:49,105
Uh, for some reason,

723
00:29:49,173 --> 00:29:51,741
Detective Decker makes me vulnerable.

724
00:29:51,809 --> 00:29:54,544
Also known as "intimacy."

725
00:29:54,612 --> 00:29:57,981
No. No, she literally
makes me exsanguinate.

726
00:29:58,048 --> 00:30:00,783
Being vulnerable can be scary.

727
00:30:00,851 --> 00:30:04,287
But there are benefits when
you open yourself up to someone.

728
00:30:04,355 --> 00:30:06,089
I just wish I knew who was behind this.

729
00:30:06,156 --> 00:30:07,223
My dad?

730
00:30:07,291 --> 00:30:08,224
My brother?

731
00:30:08,292 --> 00:30:09,559
Someone else?

732
00:30:09,627 --> 00:30:11,628
I mean, the
detective doesn't seem to know,

733
00:30:11,695 --> 00:30:12,962
but she could be lying.

734
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,497
Is she part of the plan to kill me,

735
00:30:14,565 --> 00:30:16,299
or is she just a-a pawn?

736
00:30:16,367 --> 00:30:18,301
Maybe we should explore the possibility

737
00:30:18,369 --> 00:30:21,638
that being
vulnerable can be a good thing.

738
00:30:21,705 --> 00:30:23,873
No, it can't.

739
00:30:23,941 --> 00:30:26,142
It means you're at someone else's mercy.

740
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:28,845
Then maybe you should
just stay away from everybody.

741
00:30:28,913 --> 00:30:30,647
Stay away from Chloe.

742
00:30:30,714 --> 00:30:33,616
But...

743
00:30:33,684 --> 00:30:35,752
I don't want to.

744
00:30:35,819 --> 00:30:38,254
Then don't.

745
00:30:38,322 --> 00:30:41,491
 

746
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:43,560
 I'm calling 

747
00:30:43,627 --> 00:30:45,762
 Know you hear me 

748
00:30:45,829 --> 00:30:48,031
 So I'm pleading 

749
00:30:48,098 --> 00:30:50,733
 Please forgive me 

750
00:30:50,801 --> 00:30:53,636
 'Cause there's something 

751
00:30:53,704 --> 00:30:55,972
 I've been aching 

752
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:59,409
 To confess 

753
00:30:59,476 --> 00:31:01,945
 All of this mess is 

754
00:31:02,012 --> 00:31:04,113
 All, all, all, all 

755
00:31:04,181 --> 00:31:06,749
-  All, all, all, all 
- (grunting)

756
00:31:06,817 --> 00:31:08,685
 All 

757
00:31:08,752 --> 00:31:11,154
 All, all 

758
00:31:11,221 --> 00:31:13,890
 All, all, all, all 

759
00:31:13,958 --> 00:31:16,259
 All, all, all, all 

760
00:31:16,327 --> 00:31:17,727
Amenadiel.

761
00:31:17,795 --> 00:31:20,730
 All, all 

762
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:24,233
 It's all ours. 

763
00:31:24,301 --> 00:31:25,935
PROTESTORS (chanting): Satan
is here, but God is near!

764
00:31:26,003 --> 00:31:28,137
Satan is here, but God is near!

765
00:31:28,205 --> 00:31:29,906
- Satan is here, but God is near!
- You!

766
00:31:29,974 --> 00:31:31,641
I know you're behind this.

767
00:31:31,709 --> 00:31:32,841
Because I have seen you.

768
00:31:32,842 --> 00:31:34,711
I know what you really are.

769
00:31:34,778 --> 00:31:36,045
What I am is annoyed.

770
00:31:36,113 --> 00:31:37,780
Just let me go to my club

771
00:31:37,848 --> 00:31:38,982
and move along, please.

772
00:31:39,049 --> 00:31:41,718
I know these murders are your doing!

773
00:31:41,785 --> 00:31:43,252
I have no skeletons in my closet,

774
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,855
which is more than can be
said for you nasty little humans.

775
00:31:45,923 --> 00:31:48,858
So come on, preacher
man, enough about me,

776
00:31:48,926 --> 00:31:51,127
let's talk about your
dark and nasties, shall we?

777
00:31:51,195 --> 00:31:54,564
I must throw you into a
lake of sulfur and fire.

778
00:31:54,632 --> 00:31:56,566
Oh, so you want to destroy me.

779
00:31:56,634 --> 00:31:58,468
Well, get in line.

780
00:31:58,535 --> 00:32:00,737
Yes, I wish...

781
00:32:00,804 --> 00:32:01,604
Yes.

782
00:32:01,672 --> 00:32:03,406
I never met you.

783
00:32:03,474 --> 00:32:05,241
It's like some kind of
collective amnesia.

784
00:32:05,309 --> 00:32:06,909
I mean, I walk
around this city of yours,

785
00:32:06,944 --> 00:32:08,878
solving its filthy little crimes,

786
00:32:08,946 --> 00:32:10,413
and this is the thanks I get?

787
00:32:10,481 --> 00:32:11,314
You're a murderer.

788
00:32:11,382 --> 00:32:12,315
A murderer!

789
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:16,119
Stop blaming me!

790
00:32:17,821 --> 00:32:20,289
I should destroy you.

791
00:32:20,357 --> 00:32:22,091
- MAN: Hey, put him down!
- MALCOLM: Whoa, whoa, whoa!

792
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:23,826
Easy, easy. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

793
00:32:23,894 --> 00:32:26,195
This scumbag isn't worth it, all right?

794
00:32:26,263 --> 00:32:27,397
This isn't over.

795
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:30,333
(chuckles)

796
00:32:30,401 --> 00:32:32,435
You come to have a go at me as well?

797
00:32:32,503 --> 00:32:33,436
Nah.

798
00:32:33,504 --> 00:32:34,704
Chloe thought you might need protection

799
00:32:34,772 --> 00:32:36,005
from freaks like that.

800
00:32:36,073 --> 00:32:38,207
What I want is a drink.

801
00:32:42,146 --> 00:32:43,946
Hey, I'm sorry about earlier.

802
00:32:44,014 --> 00:32:45,748
Earlier today, or three weeks ago,

803
00:32:45,816 --> 00:32:47,583
when you broke up with me in a text?

804
00:32:47,651 --> 00:32:49,519
Chloe, I know.

805
00:32:49,586 --> 00:32:51,654
I've been looking for a
way to explain things,

806
00:32:51,722 --> 00:32:53,890
but nothing makes sense.

807
00:32:53,957 --> 00:32:55,858
I will fix this, though, I promise.

808
00:32:55,926 --> 00:32:58,127
No more promises. I
just want to do our jobs.

809
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:00,630
What's that?

810
00:33:00,698 --> 00:33:02,832
(siren wailing)

811
00:33:07,538 --> 00:33:09,472
(indistinct radio transmission)

812
00:33:15,946 --> 00:33:17,914
This definitely doesn't belong here.

813
00:33:17,981 --> 00:33:20,216
A monogrammed "M."

814
00:33:21,318 --> 00:33:22,648
Doesn't Lucifer wear cuff links?

815
00:33:35,331 --> 00:33:38,220
Realy? No prints, no skin cells?

816
00:33:38,287 --> 00:33:39,488
Nope. Dead end.

817
00:33:39,555 --> 00:33:41,490
Unless you want to check Lucifer's
closet for the match.

818
00:33:41,557 --> 00:33:42,524
Very funny.

819
00:33:42,592 --> 00:33:44,392
Yo, Decker, your partner's on TV.

820
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,328
NEWSCASTER: A video went viral today

821
00:33:46,395 --> 00:33:48,630
after a fight erupted
on Hollywood Boulevard.

822
00:33:48,698 --> 00:33:51,299
Local club owner Lucifer Morningstar

823
00:33:51,367 --> 00:33:55,170
attacked Reverend Jacob
Williams when Williams claimed

824
00:33:55,238 --> 00:33:57,172
the businessman with the devilish name

825
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,707
was actually involved

826
00:33:58,774 --> 00:34:01,676
in the Satanic murders
making recent headlines.

827
00:34:01,744 --> 00:34:03,278
Apparently, I'm not the only one.

828
00:34:03,346 --> 00:34:04,346
This is ridiculous.

829
00:34:04,413 --> 00:34:05,747
He didn't attack the guy.

830
00:34:05,815 --> 00:34:07,649
He was defending himself.

831
00:34:09,051 --> 00:34:10,719
Still hot.

832
00:34:12,021 --> 00:34:14,122
Sorry.

833
00:34:20,129 --> 00:34:21,363
The preacher.

834
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:22,731
Preacher's wearing a cuff link.

835
00:34:22,798 --> 00:34:23,899
So what?

836
00:34:23,966 --> 00:34:25,066
A lot of guys do.

837
00:34:25,134 --> 00:34:26,034
One?

838
00:34:26,102 --> 00:34:27,602
With an "M"?

839
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,803
DAN: No way.

840
00:34:28,871 --> 00:34:30,171
Oh...

841
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,172
It's not an "M."

842
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,909
It's a "W," for Williams.

843
00:34:33,976 --> 00:34:35,310
Come on, Dan, it makes sense.

844
00:34:35,378 --> 00:34:36,578
Who's gonna want to kill Satanists

845
00:34:36,646 --> 00:34:38,179
more than a religious zealot?

846
00:34:39,982 --> 00:34:41,016
We gotta find him.

847
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:43,084
MALCOLM: Freakin' street preacher

848
00:34:43,152 --> 00:34:44,753
and his little minions, man.

849
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,855
Who do they think they are?

850
00:34:46,923 --> 00:34:49,858
Bunch of posers. (chuckles)

851
00:34:49,926 --> 00:34:50,859
Ah...

852
00:34:50,927 --> 00:34:52,327
Don't even sweat it, huh?

853
00:34:52,395 --> 00:34:55,630
What do you say we get some
ladies up in here, huh?

854
00:34:55,631 --> 00:34:56,731
Blow off some steam!

855
00:34:56,799 --> 00:34:58,466
Emphasis on the "blow," huh?

856
00:34:58,534 --> 00:35:00,468
(chuckling)

857
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,574
Why are you in my house?

858
00:35:06,475 --> 00:35:08,577
Because I got your back, man.

859
00:35:08,644 --> 00:35:11,813
I saw the way they
treated you at the crime scene.

860
00:35:11,881 --> 00:35:14,616
Anyways, I know you
didn't kill those people.

861
00:35:14,684 --> 00:35:16,084
Did you?

862
00:35:18,487 --> 00:35:21,790
(laughing) I'm just joking! God...

863
00:35:21,857 --> 00:35:24,626
You need to relax, get
yourself a little shiatsu.

864
00:35:24,694 --> 00:35:25,760
Mmm.

865
00:35:25,828 --> 00:35:27,629
Ah...

866
00:35:27,697 --> 00:35:28,730
This feels good.

867
00:35:28,798 --> 00:35:30,999
Feels good, hanging out here with you.

868
00:35:31,067 --> 00:35:34,269
I mean, ever since I, you
know, went to Hell, it's just...

869
00:35:34,337 --> 00:35:36,938
there's been things in my head

870
00:35:37,006 --> 00:35:39,441
that no one would understand.

871
00:35:41,077 --> 00:35:42,344
Except you, of course.

872
00:35:42,411 --> 00:35:44,379
You know?

873
00:35:44,447 --> 00:35:46,114
I just want you to know...

874
00:35:46,182 --> 00:35:48,950
I respect the hell out of you.

875
00:35:49,018 --> 00:35:50,385
(giggles)

876
00:35:50,453 --> 00:35:51,186
Get it?

877
00:35:51,253 --> 00:35:52,988
Hell? (laughs)

878
00:35:53,055 --> 00:35:54,422
Up top.

879
00:35:58,361 --> 00:36:00,562
What, you just gonna leave me hanging?

880
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:03,031
You've got red paint on your hand.

881
00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:04,265
Huh?

882
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:06,301
Just like the paint we
found at the warehouse.

883
00:36:06,369 --> 00:36:07,802
I must've gotten it on me at the scene.

884
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:09,004
Oh, I doubt that.

885
00:36:09,071 --> 00:36:11,306
Everyone was wearing gloves.

886
00:36:18,447 --> 00:36:19,881
Aw, man!

887
00:36:19,949 --> 00:36:21,249
You caught me!

888
00:36:21,317 --> 00:36:23,051
Literally red-handed. (laughs)

889
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:25,053
Oh, I was, I was wondering

890
00:36:25,121 --> 00:36:26,888
when you'd figure it out.

891
00:36:26,956 --> 00:36:29,724
You know, when I asked if you did it?

892
00:36:29,792 --> 00:36:32,160
Totally thought you were gonna ask me.

893
00:36:32,228 --> 00:36:34,362
Been dying all day to tell you.

894
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:36,498
You?

895
00:36:36,565 --> 00:36:37,632
Uh-huh.

896
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,600
You did this?

897
00:36:38,668 --> 00:36:40,001
You killed those people?

898
00:36:40,069 --> 00:36:41,838
Oh, you mean those frauds?

899
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:42,437
Duh!

900
00:36:42,505 --> 00:36:43,985
So, what do you... what do you think?

901
00:36:44,006 --> 00:36:45,607
Impressed? Hmm?

902
00:36:45,675 --> 00:36:46,741
You're insane.

903
00:36:46,809 --> 00:36:48,076
I know! It's...

904
00:36:48,144 --> 00:36:49,244
Don't you love it?

905
00:36:49,311 --> 00:36:50,578
I mean, of course you do.

906
00:36:50,646 --> 00:36:51,713
I mean, we're the same.

907
00:36:51,781 --> 00:36:54,249
Oh, we are not the same.

908
00:36:54,316 --> 00:36:55,850
Wait, wait, wait.

909
00:36:55,918 --> 00:36:58,319
I-If you're worried,

910
00:36:58,387 --> 00:37:02,257
I've got the perfect
person to pin it on:

911
00:37:02,324 --> 00:37:03,792
that street preacher.

912
00:37:03,859 --> 00:37:05,060
Genius, right?

913
00:37:05,127 --> 00:37:06,327
Guy's crazy. Yeah.

914
00:37:06,395 --> 00:37:08,786
And I already dropped
some evidence, so it's...

915
00:37:08,787 --> 00:37:10,298
Whoa!

916
00:37:10,366 --> 00:37:12,300
But I did this for you.

917
00:37:12,368 --> 00:37:13,268
Aren't you happy?

918
00:37:13,335 --> 00:37:15,370
Why would I be happy?

919
00:37:15,438 --> 00:37:17,539
I'm not evil. I punish evil.

920
00:37:17,606 --> 00:37:18,773
- Yeah, but, but you're, you know...
- The Devil, yes.

921
00:37:18,841 --> 00:37:20,141
And you think you know
who that is, don't you?

922
00:37:20,209 --> 00:37:22,043
The whole world does.

923
00:37:22,111 --> 00:37:24,412
A torturer, maybe.

924
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,182
An inflictor of just desserts, sure.

925
00:37:27,249 --> 00:37:29,684
But a senseless murderer I am not.

926
00:37:29,752 --> 00:37:32,454
Perhaps I need to clarify my position.

927
00:37:32,521 --> 00:37:33,855
Hey, hold on, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

928
00:37:33,923 --> 00:37:35,523
I've got this, remember?

929
00:37:35,591 --> 00:37:36,591
(laughs)

930
00:37:36,659 --> 00:37:37,926
Don't worry, Malcolm.

931
00:37:37,993 --> 00:37:39,427
I'm not gonna send you to Hell.

932
00:37:39,495 --> 00:37:42,297
I'm going to bring it right to you.

933
00:37:44,133 --> 00:37:45,800
And after I'm finished with you,

934
00:37:45,868 --> 00:37:47,202
Detective Decker can put you

935
00:37:47,269 --> 00:37:48,536
in a cold, dark room

936
00:37:48,604 --> 00:37:50,604
so you can think about what
you've done, young man.

937
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,374
Oh...

938
00:37:53,442 --> 00:37:54,442
(both laughing)

939
00:37:57,012 --> 00:37:58,413
(whimpering)

940
00:37:58,481 --> 00:37:59,914
Ah!

941
00:37:59,982 --> 00:38:02,524
AMENADIEL: Why don't you
pick on someone your own size?

942
00:38:14,556 --> 00:38:18,190
After the
monumentally dreadful day I've had,

943
00:38:18,191 --> 00:38:20,098
you decide to drop in now?

944
00:38:20,166 --> 00:38:21,400
I'm clearing up your mess, by the way,

945
00:38:21,467 --> 00:38:22,534
so if you don't mind.

946
00:38:22,602 --> 00:38:24,536
You sent your demon to seduce me

947
00:38:24,604 --> 00:38:25,938
and then kill me.

948
00:38:26,005 --> 00:38:27,940
- (Lucifer chuckles)
- AMENADIEL: Yeah.

949
00:38:28,007 --> 00:38:30,208
I definitely mind.

950
00:38:32,345 --> 00:38:33,211
Right.

951
00:38:33,279 --> 00:38:34,079
Wonderful.

952
00:38:34,147 --> 00:38:35,447
Now look what you've done.

953
00:38:35,515 --> 00:38:37,149
The man you just freed...

954
00:38:37,216 --> 00:38:38,617
you know, the one you
raised from the dead...

955
00:38:38,685 --> 00:38:39,818
he's murdering humans.

956
00:38:39,886 --> 00:38:43,522
And that... that is
on your hands, brother.

957
00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:44,890
You're wrong.

958
00:38:44,958 --> 00:38:46,325
It's your fault.

959
00:38:46,392 --> 00:38:47,526
Oh...

960
00:38:47,593 --> 00:38:49,361
It always has been.

961
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,564
Hate to break it to you, bro...

962
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,700
(grunts)

963
00:38:54,767 --> 00:38:55,867
but this time, I'm fighting back.

964
00:38:55,935 --> 00:38:57,302
(grunting)

965
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:59,671
If only you'd done what
was asked of you,

966
00:38:59,739 --> 00:39:00,939
none of this would've happened,

967
00:39:00,974 --> 00:39:02,641
and I'd still be home...

968
00:39:02,709 --> 00:39:03,909
(grunts)

969
00:39:03,977 --> 00:39:05,043
where I belong!

970
00:39:05,111 --> 00:39:08,046
Heaven? Really?

971
00:39:08,114 --> 00:39:09,648
You're sure that's still home, eh?

972
00:39:09,716 --> 00:39:11,450
After everything you've done?

973
00:39:13,252 --> 00:39:15,187
Sleeping with a demon.

974
00:39:15,254 --> 00:39:18,690
Think Dad might have another
assignment for you.

975
00:39:18,758 --> 00:39:21,226
Somewhere, I don't
know, slightly warmer.

976
00:39:22,228 --> 00:39:23,462
(yells)

977
00:39:29,435 --> 00:39:30,802
Why?

978
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:32,704
Why did you have to use her?

979
00:39:32,772 --> 00:39:35,173
(laughs)

980
00:39:35,241 --> 00:39:38,243
Now I get what this
little tantrum's really about.

981
00:39:38,311 --> 00:39:40,045
It's about Maze.

982
00:39:40,113 --> 00:39:41,613
You like her.

983
00:39:41,681 --> 00:39:44,016
Well, I mean, I don't
blame you, brother.

984
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:46,551
She is a wild woman in the sack.

985
00:39:52,158 --> 00:39:53,458
Listen, if you wanted me dead,

986
00:39:53,526 --> 00:39:55,861
you should've had the
balls to do it yourself!

987
00:39:57,764 --> 00:39:59,364
Oh, please.

988
00:39:59,432 --> 00:40:02,034
You're the one who's been
using pawns from the start.

989
00:40:02,101 --> 00:40:03,568
Linda, Malcolm, huh?

990
00:40:03,636 --> 00:40:05,504
Now the detective.

991
00:40:07,073 --> 00:40:09,007
You're a coward!
- Chloe?

992
00:40:09,075 --> 00:40:11,710
I don't even know
what you're talking about!

993
00:40:11,778 --> 00:40:13,578
You always were a lousy liar.

994
00:40:19,252 --> 00:40:21,453
You justify it all, don't you?

995
00:40:21,521 --> 00:40:22,654
Claim it's all done

996
00:40:22,722 --> 00:40:24,956
in the name of our father,

997
00:40:25,024 --> 00:40:26,825
but...

998
00:40:26,893 --> 00:40:29,361
it's for your sake, brother.

999
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:31,063
And they call me the prideful one.

1000
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:33,565
Enough!

1001
00:40:33,633 --> 00:40:35,634
I'm the pawn.

1002
00:40:35,701 --> 00:40:38,570
You both used me.

1003
00:40:39,073 --> 00:40:41,007
You know what?

1004
00:40:41,075 --> 00:40:42,008
Here.

1005
00:40:44,078 --> 00:40:45,978
Kill each other.

1006
00:41:00,227 --> 00:41:01,928
(sighs)

1007
00:41:03,163 --> 00:41:05,798
Now where do I get a drink?

1008
00:41:05,866 --> 00:41:08,234
The last place the
preacher was seen was near LUX.

1009
00:41:08,302 --> 00:41:11,337
Remember, he's to be
considered armed and dangerous.

1010
00:41:11,405 --> 00:41:12,872
Malcolm took Lucifer into the club.

1011
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,474
You guys see
anything, you get on the radio.

1012
00:41:14,541 --> 00:41:15,541
All right, I'll check the club.

1013
00:41:15,609 --> 00:41:16,809
You guys search the area.

1014
00:41:16,877 --> 00:41:19,145
 

1015
00:41:19,213 --> 00:41:22,448
 I was looking for you 

1016
00:41:25,853 --> 00:41:29,489
-  In all the right places 
- Mmm.

1017
00:41:29,556 --> 00:41:31,691
Hello, Detective.

1018
00:41:31,758 --> 00:41:33,459
If you've come to have a
shot at me, now's the time.

1019
00:41:33,527 --> 00:41:35,661
Everyone's doing it.

1020
00:41:36,763 --> 00:41:39,198
Yeah, your scuffle with the preacher

1021
00:41:39,266 --> 00:41:40,766
made the local news.

1022
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:41,767
(laughs)

1023
00:41:41,835 --> 00:41:42,969
Oh, that.

1024
00:41:43,036 --> 00:41:45,304
That was about five disasters ago.

1025
00:41:45,372 --> 00:41:47,373
God, your face...

1026
00:41:47,441 --> 00:41:48,608
Yeah, well, what can I say?

1027
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:50,343
You should've seen the other chap.

1028
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:51,777
Thought I did.

1029
00:41:51,845 --> 00:41:52,912
What happened?

1030
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:55,214
(scoffs) Well...

1031
00:41:55,282 --> 00:41:56,849
where do I begin?

1032
00:41:56,917 --> 00:42:00,686
With the grandest fall
in the history of time?

1033
00:42:00,754 --> 00:42:02,688
Or perhaps the far more agonizing

1034
00:42:02,756 --> 00:42:04,624
punishment that followed?

1035
00:42:06,093 --> 00:42:07,293
To be blamed for every

1036
00:42:07,361 --> 00:42:10,630
morsel of evil humanity's endured,

1037
00:42:10,697 --> 00:42:13,399
every atrocity committed in my name?

1038
00:42:13,467 --> 00:42:15,568
 Trying to impress you 

1039
00:42:15,636 --> 00:42:20,139
As though I wanted people to suffer.

1040
00:42:20,207 --> 00:42:22,475
All I ever wanted

1041
00:42:22,543 --> 00:42:24,877
was to be my own man here.

1042
00:42:24,945 --> 00:42:27,847
To be judged for my own doing.

1043
00:42:27,915 --> 00:42:29,148
And for that?

1044
00:42:30,484 --> 00:42:32,552
I've been shown how
truly powerless I am.

1045
00:42:34,621 --> 00:42:36,455
That even the people I trusted...

1046
00:42:36,523 --> 00:42:38,457
the one person, you...

1047
00:42:38,525 --> 00:42:41,060
(sighs sadly)

1048
00:42:41,128 --> 00:42:43,062
could be used to hurt me.

1049
00:42:44,131 --> 00:42:45,064
Lucifer...

1050
00:42:45,132 --> 00:42:47,366
Yes?

1051
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,474
(laughing) What?

1052
00:42:55,542 --> 00:42:57,410
Put your hands up and
move away from the bar.

1053
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:05,084
Detective, there's an explanation...

1054
00:43:05,152 --> 00:43:06,085
Stop!

1055
00:43:06,153 --> 00:43:07,153
Don't say another word.

1056
00:43:07,221 --> 00:43:08,154
Put your hands up.

1057
00:43:10,824 --> 00:43:12,491
Or you'll leave us no choice.

1058
00:43:14,161 --> 00:43:16,963
Lucifer Morningstar,
you're under arrest.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>

1
00:00:00,934 --> 00:00:03,144
<i>Previously on</i> lucifer...
(phone chimes)

2
00:00:03,137 --> 00:00:04,967
Don't worry,
I'll answer for you.

3
00:00:04,972 --> 00:00:06,742
Chloe:
<i>He ended it with me tonight</i>

4
00:00:06,741 --> 00:00:07,941
With a text.

5
00:00:07,942 --> 00:00:09,482
Who do you want me to kill?

6
00:00:09,477 --> 00:00:10,737
Lucifer morningstar.

7
00:00:10,745 --> 00:00:11,935
Bye-bye, devil.

8
00:00:11,946 --> 00:00:13,706
This is
my pentecostal coin.

9
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:15,554
Subway token for the damned.

10
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:18,149
It's all yours
if you don't shoot me.

11
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:20,552
Leave the bottle.

12
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:22,024
<i>I had sex with your brother.</i>

13
00:00:22,023 --> 00:00:24,723
That puts you
in my good graces how?

14
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:26,885
Well, I was his inside woman,

15
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:28,664
And now I'm yours.

16
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:30,862
(gunshots)
lucifer:
<i>Why is it that sometimes</i>

17
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:33,095
I'm immortal...

18
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,100
<i>And other times</i>
<i>I'm all too human?</i>

19
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:39,743
It appears that you
make me vulnerable.

20
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,040
(men chanting)

21
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:50,875
(crying)

22
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:54,252
Man:
<i>Colligitur</i>

23
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:57,355
<i>Hoc sacrificare</i>

24
00:00:57,358 --> 00:00:59,318
<i>Adulescentulam virginem</i>

25
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:03,056
<i>Magna atque magnifica.</i>

26
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:06,768
Lucifer!

27
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:08,427
(screaming)

28
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:22,209
â™ª I ain't no angel

29
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,560
â™ª don't got no halo

30
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:39,633
â™ª I cut off my wings

31
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:43,303
â™ª made my mama scream

32
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:44,904
â™ª whoa

33
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:47,235
â™ª I'm your darkest dream...

34
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:49,071
That...

35
00:01:49,076 --> 00:01:51,636
Was hot.

36
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,775
â™ª they call me devil

37
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:58,051
â™ª my heart is empty

38
00:01:58,052 --> 00:01:59,522
â™ª they call me devil...

39
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,050
Let's make it even hotter

40
00:02:01,055 --> 00:02:02,985
For the real lucifer.

41
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,560
"real lucifer"?

42
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:06,929
Trust me.

43
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:08,957
â™ª I'll steal your soul

44
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:11,633
â™ª I'll eat you whole

45
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:15,932
â™ª ain't no other way,
they call me devil â™ª

46
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,566
â™ª and you should be afraid...

47
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:20,811
(metallic clang)
(gasps)

48
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:23,008
Baby?

49
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,880
Come on, this isn't funny!

50
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,310
(grunts)

51
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,546
(screams)

52
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:37,891
(grunts)

53
00:02:37,892 --> 00:02:39,422
Well?

54
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:42,434
No.

55
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:44,099
Not a scratch.

56
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:45,498
Right, well, that
rules out iron.

57
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,469
Try the copper.

58
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:54,113
You know exactly what's
causing your vulnerability.

59
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:56,278
Chloe decker is the one
I should be throwing knives at.

60
00:02:56,277 --> 00:02:57,737
Who knows
what she's hiding.

61
00:02:57,745 --> 00:03:00,375
Yes, she seems to be
the one thing that can hurt me,

62
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:01,751
But there may be
other things as well.

63
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:04,319
The detective may simply be
a cog in a bigger machine.

64
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:06,448
This is called being thorough.

65
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:07,623
More like denial.

66
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:08,991
Because if you really thought

67
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:10,459
That I could hurt you
with these,

68
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:11,787
You wouldn't let me

69
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,192
Throw them at you.

70
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:16,658
Very funny.

71
00:03:16,664 --> 00:03:18,734
Demon daggers forged in hell
don't count.

72
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:21,602
We all know those prick.

73
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,702
And speaking of,

74
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:27,305
How's my brother?

75
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:30,108
Three weeks
of a whole lot of this?

76
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,440
How do you think he's doing?

77
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:33,906
You're not going
steady, maze.

78
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,654
You're getting close
to him for a reason.

79
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:36,649
Don't forget it.

80
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,820
I haven't.

81
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:39,148
And I don't think amenadiel

82
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:40,753
Is the one weaponizing chloe.

83
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,054
You don't <i>think?</i>

84
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:44,016
Game's too dangerous
to be guessing.

85
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:46,024
I <i>think</i> it's time to send

86
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:48,356
My brother back to high heaven.

87
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:53,232
Forcibly, if necessary.

88
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:59,566
(shouts, grunting)

89
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:00,643
(laughing)

90
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:02,841
See, there is something else.

91
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:05,683
(elevator bell dings)
it seems italian marble
is also a threat, so...

92
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:07,809
(doors opening)

93
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:09,305
Oh.

94
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:10,516
Detective?

95
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:11,777
What a surprise.

96
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,185
Where have you been?

97
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:14,447
Ah, you know me--
busy, busy.

98
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:16,355
No rest for the wicked.
Right.

99
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:19,517
'cause deviant foreplay
is so time-consuming.

100
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:20,726
Want to watch?

101
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:21,788
I've been calling you

102
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:23,225
For three weeks.

103
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,160
Why are you avoiding me?

104
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:26,625
Well, I do have a business
to run, detective.

105
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:28,804
I can't play
good cop/handsome devil cop

106
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:30,402
All the time.

107
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:32,604
I've got a case
that I can't do without you.

108
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,166
Really?
(stammers)

109
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:37,275
What's so special about it?

110
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:41,054
You just have
to see for yourself.

111
00:04:41,048 --> 00:04:43,518
Right.

112
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:45,077
â™ª ah, ah

113
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:46,815
â™ª oh, no

114
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,490
â™ª ah, ah-ah-ah-ah

115
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:49,819
â™ª oh, no

116
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:51,223
(sirens wailing)
â™ª ah, ah

117
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:52,355
(protestors chanting)
â™ª oh, no

118
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:55,089
â™ª no, she don't mess around

119
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:56,895
â™ª no, she don't
mess around... â™ª

120
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:58,197
We don't know a lot yet,

121
00:04:58,198 --> 00:04:59,928
But we found the
victim's purse

122
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:01,233
In a dumpster
behind the theater.

123
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:02,995
Her name's rose davis.

124
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:05,103
She's 19 and...

125
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:07,105
What are you
doing back there?

126
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:08,707
Just listening
to your boring facts.

127
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:11,239
She's a freshman at pasadena
city college, lives in arca--

128
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:12,535
Yeah, excuse me, detective,
I'm not hearing

129
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:14,676
Any reasons to why
you need me on this case.

130
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:16,112
I don't know
how you can hear anything--

131
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:17,516
You're standing
five feet away from me.

132
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:18,518
Get over here.

133
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,319
You sound phlegmy.

134
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,520
I don't want to get sick.

135
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:21,751
Really? Let's go.

136
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:24,255
Protestors (chanting):
Satan is here, but god is near!

137
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:26,528
Satan is here, but god is near!
Satan is here...

138
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:28,657
You.

139
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,402
Evil is here.

140
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:32,357
Evil is here.

141
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:34,626
Protestors (chanting):
Satan is here, but god is near!

142
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:37,965
Satan is here, but god is near!
I meet a lot of people.

143
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:39,541
Satan is here, but god...

144
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,540
Take the sheet off.

145
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:47,845
(camera shutter clicking)

146
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,278
Oh, well.

147
00:05:50,284 --> 00:05:51,724
That is unfortunate.

148
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:55,889
But I still don't understand
why you need me on this case.

149
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,619
Roll her over.

150
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,727
That's why.

151
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,430
Lucifer:
"hail lucifer"?

152
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:07,501
(camera shutter clicking)

153
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:09,501
â™ª

154
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,982
This is sickening.

155
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:23,182
I know.

156
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:24,353
It's horrific.

157
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:26,281
No, I mean, to
blame it on me.

158
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:27,946
It's an atrocity.

159
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:29,715
These satanists.

160
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,463
Misguided cult nobheads

161
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,058
With frisbees in
their earlobes.

162
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,330
This poor girl's death

163
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:36,188
Has nothing to do
with me, detective.

164
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:37,726
Man: This is your doing!
This is your fault!

165
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,201
You, what are you
doing in here?

166
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,299
You're the devil!

167
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,100
You're the king of all evil!

168
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:44,202
You're the king
of all lies!

169
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:45,444
You must be destroyed!

170
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,609
I'm gonna give you what for

171
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:47,967
If you don't get out
of my crime scene, pal.

172
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:49,135
Who let this guy through?

173
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:50,343
He's the devil!

174
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:51,984
I'll rise again
against you!

175
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:54,579
No thanks necessary.

176
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:58,281
Just wanted to do my part
for the man of the hour.

177
00:06:58,285 --> 00:06:59,615
It's the wink
with the porn stache

178
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,450
Sending the wrong message,
I think.

179
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:02,215
(laughs)

180
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:03,322
Do you two know
each other?

181
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:05,693
Nope, just heard
a lot about this guy.

182
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:06,792
All bad, of course.

183
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:09,164
Detective malcolm graham.

184
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,230
I wasn't gonna tell her
we're already buddies.

185
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:15,833
You know,
me trying to kill you,

186
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:17,366
The whole magic coin thing.

187
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:18,601
Tmi-- am I right?

188
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,965
I'd like you to stop
touching me now.

189
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,374
(laughs)

190
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:24,236
Ah, you're hilarious.

191
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:26,244
We should get a drink sometime.

192
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:28,446
Yeah, maybe play some pool, huh?

193
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:36,324
Hey, chloe?

194
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:38,523
If, uh, if we could talk soon,

195
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:40,155
Some stuff went down
with malcolm.

196
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,760
I mean, I know now's
a bad time...

197
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:43,862
Yeah, it is.

198
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:46,404
This bruising here
around the stab wounds.

199
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,730
Dan:
Hilt marks maybe.

200
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,034
And these.

201
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:50,896
There's subdermal implants.

202
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:52,344
They don't look fresh.

203
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:53,539
I don't know what they are.

204
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,410
Symbols?
Designs maybe?

205
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:57,609
Well, not a lot of places do
that kind of body modification.

206
00:07:57,611 --> 00:08:00,281
Malcolm and I will try
to find who put them in.

207
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,580
All right.

208
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:04,182
He and I have to meet
rose's father at her apartment.

209
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:05,924
Right, where
is that exactly?

210
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,919
Uh, 1625 lynrose.

211
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,322
Right, I'll see you there.

212
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:11,994
What? What-what
are you doing?

213
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,232
I'm gonna take my own ride.

214
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:14,727
You're a wretched driver.

215
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:16,288
Since when?

216
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:20,726
â™ª it's colder now than it was

217
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:23,304
â™ª yesterday

218
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:25,573
â™ª warm down south

219
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:27,012
â™ª so I'm on my way...

220
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,437
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

221
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:30,442
Were you close
with your daughter?
Yes.

222
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:33,314
Well, we were
when she was little, but

223
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:35,453
You know, single father
with a teenage daughter...

224
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:38,579
Yes, I'm quite familiar
with the absentee father

225
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:39,715
Excuses.

226
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,690
Can you tell us why rose
marred herself recently

227
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,918
With subdermal implants?
What?

228
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:45,624
That doesn't sound like rosie.

229
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:49,256
This bookshelf's
been moved a lot.

230
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,567
(hinges creaking)

231
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:01,408
Oh, lovely.

232
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:04,678
Very mid-century rapist.

233
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:07,978
Hello, bad guys?

234
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,695
What is this place?

235
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:28,625
It's a creepy,
secret evil room.

236
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:30,135
You didn't know about this?

237
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:32,367
No.

238
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,139
What's this?

239
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:40,305
It's a chicken.

240
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:41,784
Or what's left of it.

241
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:43,722
If that's supposed to be
an offering for me,

242
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:46,587
Then I decline on grounds
of salmonella.

243
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:50,721
This picture, th--

244
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:52,924
This isn't rose.

245
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,490
Mr. Davis, I'm so sorry.

246
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:58,696
But maybe this wasn't
a random attack.

247
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:01,169
Maybe your daughter was involved
with whoever killed her.

248
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:02,828
It's a large man
by the looks of it,

249
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:06,536
Who's, uh,
not a fan of bathing.

250
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,140
Mr. Davis:
This is crazy.

251
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:10,681
I mean, even if she was
into this stupid devil thing,

252
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:12,707
She wouldn't have
sacrificed herself.

253
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:15,153
Yes, but sometimes the people
closest to you can turn on you.

254
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:17,048
Wouldn't you agree, detective?

255
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,580
Maybe.

256
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:23,917
"for my corazon.

257
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:24,724
Love, rose."

258
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:25,785
"corazon" is spanish for heart.

259
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,392
Could be a term of endearment.

260
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:30,425
Could be a name.

261
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:34,200
Mr. Davis: I should've
reached out.

262
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:36,571
Called more.

263
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,700
I thought I knew her.

264
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:42,865
Oh, yes, I know
exactly how you feel.

265
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,876
(phone rings)

266
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,683
Decker.

267
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:51,822
We called around, found the girl
that gave rose her subdermals.

268
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,648
Said she, uh, came in a
couple weeks ago with a guy.

269
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:56,655
Weird guy, apparently,
with a weird name, too,

270
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:58,217
But she can't remember it.

271
00:10:58,225 --> 00:10:59,855
Ask if the name's corazon.

272
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,160
Hey.
Was the guy's name corazon?

273
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,603
Yeah, that's it.

274
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:06,798
Uh, jet black hair,
lots of piercings and tattoos.

275
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,927
Did you hear that?

276
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:11,096
Yeah, generic satanist.

277
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:13,674
What about the, uh, subdermals--
she know what they mean?

278
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:16,314
Says rose brought them
in herself.

279
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,339
She was super secretive
about 'em.

280
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,475
Uh-huh.

281
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,379
We'll talk soon.

282
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:23,381
Ah, look at you two.
(sighs)

283
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:24,723
Marriage falling apart,

284
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:26,178
Trying to work together...

285
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,746
So cute.

286
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:29,454
Yeah, well, maybe if you hadn't
sent her a break-up text

287
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:31,356
While I was unconscious...
Oh.

288
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,018
Hey, speaking of

289
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,556
Kicking your ass, I'm proud
of you for bouncing back.

290
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:37,332
Friends fight, right?

291
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,830
Yeah.

292
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:40,632
Dick.

293
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:42,834
(distant siren wailing)

294
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,874
(alarm chirps)

295
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:50,681
(growling)

296
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:51,877
(grunts)

297
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,106
Why is lucifer still alive?

298
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:56,105
Oh, it's you.

299
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:57,146
You scared me, dude.

300
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,650
Have you forgotten
what will happen to you

301
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:00,122
If you don't comply
with our deal?

302
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,120
No, but I forgot to tell you!

303
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:05,063
Lucifer spilled the beans.

304
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:09,587
What are you talking about?

305
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:10,656
All that jazz about

306
00:12:10,664 --> 00:12:12,704
Condemning me
to eternal damnation?

307
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:14,369
Poppycock, apparently.

308
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:16,167
You're an angel

309
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:18,899
And lucifer said that
you're not allowed to kill me.

310
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,805
Plus...

311
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:22,667
I got this beauty right here.

312
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:25,176
It's my
get-out-of-hell-free card.

313
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:27,178
(growls)

314
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:31,254
(sighs)

315
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,821
So...

316
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:36,189
Unless you got
a better offer...

317
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:40,159
#teamlucifer.

318
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,460
It's not half bad, this.

319
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,262
I mean, the writing's atrocious,

320
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,034
But it's not complete drivel.

321
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:46,972
Listen to this:

322
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:49,697
"satan represents
a beacon of honesty

323
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:53,173
In a sea of mass
self-deceit."

324
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:54,173
Mmm.

325
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:55,374
And... Oh. Hello.

326
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,505
There's a whole chapter on sex.

327
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,780
I like this book.

328
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:01,351
Rose's subdermal implants--

329
00:13:01,348 --> 00:13:03,578
I'm pretty sure they're letters.

330
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,283
But I've arranged them
100 different ways

331
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:09,046
And I can't come up
with anything significant.

332
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:12,485
"chili furis"?

333
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:16,532
"I hurl ficis"?

334
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:19,934
No.

335
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:22,673
But could... Could you
come over here, please?

336
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,679
Oh, bloody hell.

337
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,654
<i>Filii hircus.</i>
<i>It's latin.</i>

338
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,780
Means "children of the goat."

339
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:39,684
Why do they always
associate me with goats?

340
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:41,286
I mean, I don't even
like their cheese.

341
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:43,764
Here we go.

342
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:45,217
"church of the dark prince."

343
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,131
Location is secret.

344
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,630
Looks like you have
to be a member.

345
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:56,102
Geez, look at
this questionnaire.

346
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:57,742
Oh, and of course,

347
00:13:57,737 --> 00:13:59,237
There's a fee.

348
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:00,809
$200? Sinful.

349
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:03,337
There's got to be a faster way.

350
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:06,513
Lucifer:
"what is your gift
to the devil?"

351
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:09,853
Chloe:
How about... <i>Filii hircus?</i>

352
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,350
Yes!

353
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,581
(mumbling to self)

354
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,919
All right.
Okay... What...

355
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:18,092
Yeah, I'll see you there!

356
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,132
What...?

357
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:23,697
â™ª

358
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:34,605
(clears throat)

359
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,509
Okay.

360
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:40,551
That's it.

361
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:41,677
You're being a freak.

362
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:43,951
You've been avoiding
me for weeks,

363
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,420
You won't get
in my car.

364
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:46,648
What's your problem?

365
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:47,693
There's no problem.

366
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,147
Just maybe
you're not as charming

367
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,955
As you think you are.

368
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,788
Wait, is this about
that vulnerability thing?

369
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:56,904
Actually, yes.

370
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,130
I mean... I get the teensiest
bit touchy-feely with you

371
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:02,674
And you freak out.

372
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:04,339
Ugh. All I meant
that night

373
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:05,997
Is that I can trust you.

374
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:08,469
That's all.

375
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:09,465
Okay?

376
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:10,436
Okay.

377
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:11,683
Okay.

378
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:12,638
Okay.

379
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,386
(clears throat)

380
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:24,889
(whispering):
<i>Filii hircus.</i>

381
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,062
(sighs)

382
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:29,291
Habeas corpus?

383
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:30,596
Bababooey?

384
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,727
You had it right the first time.

385
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:35,032
But today is private.

386
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:39,565
Too private
for lucifer himself?

387
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:40,772
You're supposed to be blond.

388
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:43,574
Yes, I get that a lot.

389
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:45,706
You have id?
Absolutely.

390
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:47,382
Let me just, uh...

391
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,650
Oh. Dearie me.

392
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:49,908
I seem to have
left it in the car.

393
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,776
Detective, would you mind
going to fetch it, please?

394
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:53,215
What am I, your dog?

395
00:15:58,757 --> 00:15:59,887
(screams)

396
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,356
Detective...

397
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:04,362
After you.

398
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:14,935
It's very <i>eyes wide shut.</i>

399
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:16,541
Too bad I forgot
my sexy mask.

400
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:18,813
Does anything scare you?

401
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,082
Should it?

402
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,480
Man:
Rose is gone.

403
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,322
But it is not her death
that was important,

404
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,617
It was her life.

405
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:27,648
The imprint she left behind.

406
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:30,424
See, rose will be remembered.

407
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:32,523
She will live on forever.

408
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:34,785
This isn't a sacrifice.

409
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:35,934
It's a memorial.

410
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:37,399
Quite civilized,
actually.

411
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:40,897
Yeah, they don't
seem like killers.
Mmm.

412
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,370
Onyx:
And so now

413
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:44,969
It is time to invoke

414
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:47,271
The four crowned princes
of hell.

415
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:48,843
Oh. Scratch that.

416
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:50,942
Visualize the blue light

417
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:52,944
Filling your entire being.

418
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:55,546
Satan to the east.

419
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,448
Beelzebub to the north...

420
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,820
This is preposterous.

421
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:00,948
I thought
you'd love this.

422
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:02,394
First of all,
there's only one me.

423
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:04,789
And secondly, the whole worship
thing is more my father's bag.

424
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,261
And now...

425
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,190
Lucifer will speak!

426
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,196
What?

427
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:15,729
(thump)
ooh.

428
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:17,795
Oh. No. No, no,
no, no, no.

429
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:19,704
This is where
I draw the line.
Ow.

430
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:22,206
Ow.
Excuse me, excuse me! Sorry.

431
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,368
Sorry.

432
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,436
Man:
Hey, man.

433
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:26,044
If you would just butt out.

434
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:26,836
Right!

435
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:28,376
I'm the real lucifer

436
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:31,651
And I insist that you stop
this nonsense immediately.

437
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,851
I mean, have you
heard yourselves?
It's embarrassing.

438
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:35,753
Blue light coming out your ass

439
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:37,485
Or whatever it was.

440
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,660
I mean, you preach rebellion,

441
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:40,388
But you're-you're
misguided sheep.

442
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:41,963
And goat.

443
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:43,631
Where's the real defiance?

444
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,230
The free will?
Satanist:
Yeah!

445
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,231
Free will!

446
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,372
Free will rules!

447
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:48,727
(applause)

448
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,695
No, no!
You're doing it again.

449
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,003
Don't applaud.

450
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:53,595
This whole thing's a sham!

451
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:54,606
(woman whoops)

452
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:55,867
Anarchy!

453
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:56,865
(cheering, whooping)

454
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:58,106
I mean, just-just look at this.

455
00:17:58,111 --> 00:17:59,941
What is this
supposed to be?

456
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,210
Alien fetus?

457
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:04,846
Pickled demon?

458
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:06,921
He's the best lucifer
we've had in years.

459
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,020
(chanting):
Lucifer! Lucifer!

460
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:12,023
Lucifer...
Stop!

461
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,532
Someone killed this girl!

462
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:16,928
She didn't deserve that.

463
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,200
This is not
what I stand for.

464
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:22,229
Is that what
you all wanted? Eh?

465
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:29,108
Should be ashamed of yourselves.

466
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,652
Lapd.

467
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:36,347
Put the knife down.

468
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:42,085
Why were
you running?

469
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:44,388
I wasn't.

470
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,390
I was upset.

471
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:46,761
Feeling guilty, are you?

472
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:47,929
Tell me... Why?

473
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:50,497
What, our new devil's
a cop, now, is he?

474
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:52,257
Lucifer:
Oh, worse than that,
I'm afraid.

475
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:53,225
So come on.

476
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:55,003
Tell me, what nasty little urge

477
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:57,371
Are you hiding
in your hoodie, hmm?

478
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,165
I want to kill...

479
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:02,244
Yeah?

480
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:05,582
I want to kill the sick bastard
who killed rose.

481
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:06,808
And then, after that,

482
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:10,283
I want the hell
out of this racket.

483
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:12,523
Oh.

484
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:14,349
What's your name?

485
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:15,454
Onyx.

486
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:16,515
Hmm?

487
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:17,923
(sighs)

488
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:19,964
Mitch watson.

489
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,889
Yeah, I changed it
when I joined the church.

490
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:25,395
12 years later,
I'm the frickin' high priest.

491
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:28,268
Kind of late for
a career change, though.

492
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:30,968
I mean,
the whole thing's a joke.

493
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,470
So, hold on...

494
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:34,612
Are you saying
you don't believe in lucifer?

495
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:37,237
Look, mate, the devil ain't
gonna buy me an aston martin.

496
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:38,843
Well, not with that attitude,
he won't.

497
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,875
I mean,
I like the philosophy.

498
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,580
But it attracts
a lot of weirdoes

499
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:44,352
Who take it way too seriously.

500
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,620
And, of course,

501
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:47,078
Now rosie's dead.

502
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:50,116
Yeah, and I see you
have the same subdermal
implants as she did.

503
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:51,463
All the hard core members...

504
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:52,587
They all get this.

505
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:53,722
I was trying to tell rosie

506
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:55,156
That she would
regret it later,

507
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:57,661
But she became obsessed.

508
00:19:57,664 --> 00:19:59,364
She was an impressionable girl.

509
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,965
Well, her father was absentee.

510
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:03,627
I suppose that's why she got
involved in all this nonsense,

511
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:05,036
To piss her dad off.

512
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:06,998
Actually, it was, uh...
It was her boyfriend,

513
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:08,836
Corazon, he's the one
who brought her in.

514
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:10,811
Man, the guy's a creeper.

515
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,610
He kept talking about doing
real sacrifices on animals.

516
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:16,883
Did corazon have
access to this knife?

517
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:19,153
Yeah, probably.

518
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,422
This here is just for show.

519
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:25,622
The blade springs
inside the handle.

520
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,085
Hmm. Strange.

521
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:29,293
'cause if it was real...
It could definitely match

522
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:30,755
The marks found
on rose's body.

523
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:32,503
We do have an actual version.

524
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:33,498
Hold on.

525
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,166
Knife's gone.

526
00:20:39,172 --> 00:20:40,642
Okay, we need
to find corazon now.

527
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,770
Yeah.
Do you have, um,

528
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:43,044
His real name,

529
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:44,782
Uh, where he lives,
his address?

530
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:46,177
Give me a sec.

531
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:51,184
Ugh.

532
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,492
Looks just like you.

533
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:57,048
I manscape.

534
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:01,787
I'm starting to understand
why you chose this persona.

535
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:03,794
All-powerful...

536
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:04,956
Invincible...

537
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:06,364
Not exactly.

538
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:11,836
Ah. Or it's because you think
that everybody's out to get you.

539
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:12,938
That's because they are.

540
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,639
But trust me,
I didn't choose it.

541
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:16,741
Why would anyone
choose to be vilified?

542
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:18,943
Thought the devil
was supposed to be immortal.

543
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:21,145
Well, one angel
can hurt another, so...

544
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:28,752
Oh, what...?

545
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:31,685
What are you doing?

546
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:33,321
(door opens)

547
00:21:33,326 --> 00:21:35,856
No address, no last name,

548
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:37,662
Nothing.

549
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:41,004
He used paypal to pay
for the fee.

550
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,300
All right,
I'll call in a warrant.

551
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,740
Well, if you can't bring
muhammad to the dim sum...

552
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,850
Hey.

553
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:02,593
Why'd you stand me up?

554
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:04,858
I had one task...

555
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:07,387
One...

556
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:09,733
To get my brother
back to hell.

557
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,500
I've not only failed,

558
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:19,342
But I've actually
made things worse.

559
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:21,809
I'm even sleeping with a demon.

560
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:27,213
Yeah, you lucky
son of a bitch.

561
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:31,283
Come on, you can't say

562
00:22:31,284 --> 00:22:35,554
That this isn't the best
sex you've ever had.

563
00:22:35,555 --> 00:22:38,015
Well, it is the only sex
you've ever had, but still.

564
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:40,024
(chuckles)

565
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:43,826
Look, I've had
a lot of sex,

566
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:47,100
With men and women.

567
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,830
I mean a lot.
Okay.

568
00:22:48,835 --> 00:22:50,295
Point made.

569
00:22:50,303 --> 00:22:53,843
But this, with you,

570
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,310
I don't know, it's...

571
00:22:55,308 --> 00:22:57,838
It's different.

572
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:10,285
But if you're
not happy here,

573
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:12,489
Then you should go home.

574
00:23:12,492 --> 00:23:15,592
I can't.

575
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:19,925
I can't face my father
as a failure.

576
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:21,932
Look, I have a job to do.

577
00:23:21,934 --> 00:23:24,174
There's no choice.

578
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:27,270
I understand.

579
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:37,954
Chloe:
<i>Okay. Great.</i>

580
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,220
Yeah, I'll be here.

581
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:40,478
All right.

582
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:42,546
So we got a real
name for corazon--

583
00:23:42,555 --> 00:23:44,585
Mike carey-- but it could
take us a while to find him,

584
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,760
So you should
probably head home.
Oh, no, no, no.

585
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,959
Not till this human stain's
brought to justice.

586
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:51,231
(scoffs)
I can't get near you,

587
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,960
Now I can't get rid of you.

588
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:53,955
Whatever.

589
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:55,226
I'm gonna go up and shower.

590
00:23:55,234 --> 00:23:56,904
Stay put. Do not wake up trixie.

591
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,571
â™ª

592
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:08,845
(sighs)

593
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,922
Did you just throw a toy at me?

594
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:21,186
Oh, you're awake.

595
00:24:21,194 --> 00:24:23,134
But since you're up,
I have some questions for you.

596
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:24,729
Right.

597
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,800
Are you adopted?

598
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,999
In other words, are you sure
the detective is your mother?

599
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:31,642
Could she be
from somewhere else?

600
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:33,537
Does she have
any special powers?

601
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:36,109
Uh-uh.
What about any markings?

602
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:38,908
Scars, on her back perhaps?

603
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:41,251
There's some chocolate cake
in it for you.

604
00:24:41,247 --> 00:24:43,007
I want cash.

605
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:44,545
Oh.

606
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,750
(chuckles)
I like your style.

607
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:49,723
All right.

608
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:51,422
Mommy does have a scar.

609
00:24:51,424 --> 00:24:53,424
Oh?
On her butt.

610
00:24:53,426 --> 00:24:55,126
From when she got bit.

611
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:56,587
By the kraken.

612
00:24:56,596 --> 00:24:57,826
Right.

613
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:00,257
Not the direction
I was going for,

614
00:25:00,266 --> 00:25:02,396
But what's this kraken
that you talk of?

615
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:05,171
Chloe:
My mom's evil chihuahua.

616
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:06,441
Why aren't you
showering?

617
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:07,909
'cause I left
my phone down here.

618
00:25:07,907 --> 00:25:09,167
Why is trixie awake?

619
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:11,875
(snaps)
get back in bed, young lady.

620
00:25:11,878 --> 00:25:12,908
Night, lucifer.

621
00:25:12,912 --> 00:25:15,882
All right, seriously.

622
00:25:15,882 --> 00:25:17,922
No more freaky behavior.

623
00:25:17,917 --> 00:25:19,917
If this is about the other
night, I'm sorry, okay?

624
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,319
What do you want me to do,
take it all back?

625
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:23,751
No, can you take
your shirt off, please?

626
00:25:23,756 --> 00:25:24,716
What?

627
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:27,157
Are you serious?

628
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:28,529
I need to see your back.

629
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:33,428
Because I want to know if you're
an angel sent to destroy me.

630
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:40,273
(sighs)

631
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:45,278
Nothing.

632
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:47,338
Yeah.

633
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:49,406
Is this about the scars
on your back?

634
00:25:49,415 --> 00:25:53,675
Look, I have no idea
what happened to you

635
00:25:53,686 --> 00:25:55,216
Or what's going on with you now,

636
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:58,421
But... Not everyone's
out to get you.

637
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:01,634
(phone buzzing)

638
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:04,557
They found him-- corazon.

639
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:16,369
Woman:
We found his car like this.

640
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:18,575
It's registered
to mike carey.

641
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:25,378
(clattering)
(gasps)

642
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:29,619
(malcolm chuckles)

643
00:26:29,622 --> 00:26:31,622
Just like old times, huh?

644
00:26:31,624 --> 00:26:32,994
Don't shoot me though.

645
00:26:32,992 --> 00:26:33,992
Funny.

646
00:26:33,993 --> 00:26:35,333
Come on,
I'm just joking.

647
00:26:35,328 --> 00:26:36,758
(clattering)

648
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:42,674
Ah, detective douche,
detective stache.

649
00:26:42,668 --> 00:26:43,868
What a pleasant surprise.

650
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:44,999
Did you find anything?

651
00:26:45,004 --> 00:26:46,874
Place seems empty.

652
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:59,377
Chloe (whispering):
My god.

653
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:14,768
It's definitely mike carey.

654
00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:17,897
Detectives,
can I show you something?

655
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:22,539
(siren wailing)

656
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:24,811
So what do you really
make of all this, huh?

657
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,980
The "hail, lucifer,"
the pentagram?

658
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:31,749
I think it's a long time since
I encountered genuine evil.

659
00:27:31,751 --> 00:27:33,051
Wow.

660
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:38,421
(sniffing)

661
00:27:38,424 --> 00:27:40,364
It's not blood;
it's paint.

662
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:44,897
So the killer
strapped mike up

663
00:27:44,897 --> 00:27:47,827
Then decided to go
all jackson pollock?

664
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:50,103
I guess.

665
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:53,642
Yeah, looks like an "a."

666
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:55,109
That can't be random.

667
00:27:55,107 --> 00:27:56,837
I think it's a word.

668
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:09,947
(gasps)
giant anamorphic print.

669
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:11,955
"morningstar."

670
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:14,317
Dan:
Whoa.

671
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:16,186
Another satanic message.

672
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:19,855
Morningstar is not exactly the
most common name for the devil.

673
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:22,565
You think someone did
this for our lucifer?

674
00:28:22,568 --> 00:28:24,098
That's kind of
a leap, dan.

675
00:28:24,103 --> 00:28:26,843
Yeah, but if I'm right, it's
also a conflict of interest.

676
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:28,969
Somebody could be doing
this on his behalf,

677
00:28:28,974 --> 00:28:30,714
Or maybe he's involved
in a different way.

678
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,510
What does that mean?
Lucifer: Yes.

679
00:28:32,511 --> 00:28:34,981
What are you insinuating?

680
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,510
That some psycho might
be killing people

681
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:38,045
Because of your whole
devil shtick.

682
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,620
You're blaming
this nonsense on me?

683
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:41,848
You do take the whole satan
thing pretty seriously.

684
00:28:41,854 --> 00:28:43,854
You really think
I'd do these vile things?

685
00:28:43,856 --> 00:28:46,586
These kids were
pretending to be bad,

686
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:48,132
But they weren't,
they were innocent,

687
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:50,057
So I would never hurt them,
I'm not a monster.

688
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,102
Chloe:
Okay, guys.

689
00:28:51,097 --> 00:28:52,697
That's enough.

690
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,203
Lucifer, maybe you
should go home.

691
00:28:57,203 --> 00:29:00,673
Oh, no, allow me to stay in this
rusty tin can a little longer.

692
00:29:00,673 --> 00:29:03,443
You came to me,
you insisted I work this case.

693
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:05,712
Okay, this sounds crazy,

694
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:07,681
But this case
might involve you.

695
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,010
What do you mean, involve me?

696
00:29:09,014 --> 00:29:10,054
You know what I mean.

697
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:11,779
(sighs)
I'm trying to
protect you.

698
00:29:11,784 --> 00:29:16,724
Oh, protect me from the evil
or the world from evil me?

699
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:25,658
Can you believe
detective von douche

700
00:29:25,664 --> 00:29:27,434
Boots <i>me</i> off the case?

701
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:29,173
And chloe agreed to this?

702
00:29:29,168 --> 00:29:30,568
(sighs)
she didn't disagree.

703
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:31,839
(chuckles incredulously)

704
00:29:31,837 --> 00:29:33,437
How could she even
think I'm capable?

705
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:34,569
Here?

706
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:36,773
That's why I left.

707
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:38,236
I thought she knew me.

708
00:29:38,244 --> 00:29:39,514
I thought I knew her.

709
00:29:39,512 --> 00:29:41,182
And now you don't
trust her anymore?

710
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:44,650
Oh, it's just this whole
immortality thing.

711
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,820
Uh, for some reason,

712
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:49,449
Detective decker
makes me vulnerable.

713
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:52,255
Also known as "intimacy."

714
00:29:52,258 --> 00:29:55,688
No. No, she literally
makes me exsanguinate.

715
00:29:55,694 --> 00:29:58,504
Being vulnerable can be scary.

716
00:29:58,497 --> 00:30:01,997
But there are benefits when you
open yourself up to someone.

717
00:30:02,001 --> 00:30:03,801
I just wish I knew
who was behind this.

718
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:04,943
My dad?

719
00:30:04,937 --> 00:30:05,937
My brother?

720
00:30:05,938 --> 00:30:07,268
Someone else?

721
00:30:07,273 --> 00:30:09,343
I mean, the detective
doesn't seem to know,

722
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:10,671
But she could
be lying.

723
00:30:10,676 --> 00:30:12,206
Is she part of the plan
to kill me,

724
00:30:12,211 --> 00:30:13,981
Or is she just a-a pawn?

725
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,979
Maybe we should explore
the possibility

726
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:19,321
That being vulnerable
can be a good thing.

727
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,588
No, it can't.

728
00:30:21,587 --> 00:30:23,817
It means you're at
someone else's mercy.

729
00:30:23,823 --> 00:30:26,563
Then maybe you should just
stay away from everybody.

730
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,329
Stay away from chloe.

731
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:31,327
But...

732
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,430
I don't want to.

733
00:30:33,432 --> 00:30:35,972
Then don't.

734
00:30:35,968 --> 00:30:39,168
â™ª

735
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:41,241
â™ª I'm calling

736
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,510
â™ª know you hear me

737
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:45,779
â™ª so I'm pleading

738
00:30:45,778 --> 00:30:48,508
â™ª please forgive me

739
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:51,384
â™ª 'cause there's something

740
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:53,723
â™ª I've been aching

741
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:57,189
â™ª to confess

742
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:59,719
â™ª all of this mess is

743
00:30:59,725 --> 00:31:01,855
â™ª all, all, all, all

744
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:04,491
â™ª all, all, all, all
(grunting)

745
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:06,456
â™ª all

746
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:08,895
â™ª all, all

747
00:31:08,901 --> 00:31:11,671
â™ª all, all, all, all

748
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:14,000
â™ª all, all,
all, all â™ª

749
00:31:14,006 --> 00:31:15,506
Amenadiel.

750
00:31:15,507 --> 00:31:18,507
â™ª all, all

751
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:22,010
â™ª it's all ours.

752
00:31:22,014 --> 00:31:23,714
Protestors (chanting):
Satan is here, but god is near!

753
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:25,876
Satan is here,
but god is near!

754
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:27,675
Satan is here, but god is near!
You!

755
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:29,416
I know you're behind this.

756
00:31:29,421 --> 00:31:31,491
Because I have seen you.

757
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:32,490
I know what you
really are.

758
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:33,821
What I am is annoyed.

759
00:31:33,826 --> 00:31:35,556
Just let me go
to my club

760
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:36,761
And move along, please.

761
00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:39,502
I know these murders
are your doing!

762
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:41,028
I have no skeletons
in my closet,

763
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:43,673
Which is more than can be said
for you nasty little humans.

764
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:46,699
So come on, preacher man,
enough about me,

765
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:48,965
Let's talk about your dark
and nasties, shall we?

766
00:31:48,974 --> 00:31:52,414
I must throw you into a
lake of sulfur and fire.

767
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,411
Oh, so you want to destroy me.

768
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,313
Well, get in line.

769
00:31:56,315 --> 00:31:58,575
Yes, I wish...

770
00:31:58,584 --> 00:31:59,454
Yes.

771
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:01,251
...I never met you.

772
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:03,093
It's like some kind
of collective amnesia.

773
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,718
I mean, I walk around
this city of yours,

774
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:06,723
Solving its filthy
little crimes,

775
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:08,255
And this is the thanks I get?

776
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,160
You're a murderer.

777
00:32:09,161 --> 00:32:10,161
A murderer!

778
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:13,958
Stop blaming me!

779
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,140
I should destroy you.

780
00:32:18,137 --> 00:32:19,937
Man: Hey, put him down!
Malcolm: Whoa, whoa, whoa!

781
00:32:19,939 --> 00:32:21,669
Easy, easy.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

782
00:32:21,674 --> 00:32:24,044
This scumbag isn't
worth it, all right?

783
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:25,243
This isn't over.

784
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:30,282
You come to have a
go at me as well?

785
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:32,552
Chloe thought you might
need protection

786
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:33,851
From freaks like that.

787
00:32:33,852 --> 00:32:36,052
What I want is a drink.

788
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:41,794
Hey, I'm sorry
about earlier.

789
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:43,594
Earlier today,
or three weeks ago,

790
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:45,495
When you broke up
with me in a text?

791
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:47,427
Chloe, I know.

792
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:49,573
I've been looking for
a way to explain things,

793
00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:51,798
But nothing makes sense.

794
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:53,774
I will fix this,
though, I promise.

795
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:56,042
No more promises.
I just want to do our jobs.

796
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:58,535
What's that?

797
00:32:58,544 --> 00:33:00,744
(siren wailing)

798
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:07,383
(indistinct radio transmission)

799
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:15,831
This definitely
doesn't belong here.

800
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:18,128
A monogrammed "m."

801
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,833
Doesn't lucifer
wear cuff links?

802
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,811
Chloe:
Really? No prints,
no skin cells?

803
00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:37,084
Nope. Dead end.

804
00:33:37,082 --> 00:33:39,152
Unless you want to check
lucifer's closet for the match.

805
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:40,081
Very funny.

806
00:33:40,085 --> 00:33:42,045
Yo, decker,
your partner's on tv.

807
00:33:42,054 --> 00:33:43,994
Newscaster:
A video went viral today

808
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:46,319
After a fight erupted
on hollywood boulevard.

809
00:33:46,325 --> 00:33:48,955
Local club owner
lucifer morningstar

810
00:33:48,961 --> 00:33:52,831
Attacked reverend jacob williams
when williams claimed

811
00:33:52,831 --> 00:33:54,831
The businessman
with the devilish name

812
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:56,373
Was actually involved

813
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:59,368
In the satanic murders
making recent headlines.

814
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:00,941
Apparently,
I'm not the only one.

815
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:02,039
This is ridiculous.

816
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:03,411
He didn't attack the guy.

817
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:05,309
He was defending himself.

818
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:08,377
Still hot.

819
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,824
Sorry.

820
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:19,055
The preacher.

821
00:34:19,058 --> 00:34:20,418
Preacher's wearing
a cuff link.

822
00:34:20,426 --> 00:34:21,586
So what?

823
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:22,733
A lot of guys do.

824
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:23,728
One?

825
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:25,299
With an "m"?

826
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:26,457
Dan:
No way.

827
00:34:26,465 --> 00:34:27,855
Oh...

828
00:34:27,866 --> 00:34:28,866
It's not an "m."

829
00:34:28,867 --> 00:34:31,597
It's a "w," for williams.

830
00:34:31,603 --> 00:34:33,003
Come on, dan,
it makes sense.

831
00:34:33,005 --> 00:34:34,235
Who's gonna want
to kill satanists

832
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,939
More than a religious zealot?

833
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:38,735
We gotta find him.

834
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:40,844
Malcolm:
Freakin' street preacher

835
00:34:40,846 --> 00:34:42,506
And his little minions, man.

836
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:44,614
Who do they think they are?

837
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:47,616
Bunch of posers.
(chuckles)

838
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:48,619
Ah...

839
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,090
Don't even sweat it, huh?

840
00:34:50,089 --> 00:34:51,919
What do you say we get
some ladies up in here, huh?

841
00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:54,494
Blow off some steam!

842
00:34:54,493 --> 00:34:56,233
Emphasis on the "blow," huh?

843
00:34:56,228 --> 00:34:58,228
(chuckling)

844
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:03,332
Why are you in my house?

845
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:06,338
Because I got your back, man.

846
00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:09,568
I saw the way they treated
you at the crime scene.

847
00:35:09,575 --> 00:35:12,375
Anyways, I know you didn't
kill those people.

848
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:13,837
Did you?

849
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:19,550
(laughing):
I'm just joking! God...

850
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:22,391
You need to relax,
get yourself a little shiatsu.

851
00:35:22,387 --> 00:35:23,517
Mmm.

852
00:35:23,522 --> 00:35:25,392
Ah...

853
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,360
This feels good.

854
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:28,758
Feels good,
hanging out here with you.

855
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,030
I mean, ever since I, you know,
went to hell, it's just...

856
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:34,700
There's been things in my head

857
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,270
That no one would understand.

858
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:40,166
Except you, of course.

859
00:35:40,172 --> 00:35:42,212
You know?

860
00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:43,937
I just want
you to know...

861
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:46,782
I respect the hell out of you.

862
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:48,208
(giggles)

863
00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:49,013
Get it?

864
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:50,814
Hell? (laughs)

865
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:52,246
Up top.

866
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,390
What, you just gonna
leave me hanging?

867
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:00,860
You've got red paint
on your hand.

868
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:02,059
Huh?

869
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,130
Just like the paint
we found at the warehouse.

870
00:36:04,129 --> 00:36:05,629
I must've gotten it on me
at the scene.

871
00:36:05,631 --> 00:36:06,831
Oh, I doubt that.

872
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:09,132
Everyone was wearing gloves.

873
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:17,707
Aw, man!

874
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:19,079
You caught me!

875
00:36:19,077 --> 00:36:20,877
Literally red-handed.
(laughs)

876
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:22,879
Oh, I was,
I was wondering

877
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:24,711
When you'd figure it out.

878
00:36:24,716 --> 00:36:27,546
You know, when I asked
if you did it?

879
00:36:27,553 --> 00:36:29,993
Totally thought
you were gonna ask me.

880
00:36:29,988 --> 00:36:32,188
Been dying all day to tell you.

881
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:34,321
You?

882
00:36:34,326 --> 00:36:35,456
Uh-huh.

883
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,460
You did this?

884
00:36:36,461 --> 00:36:37,891
You killed those people?

885
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:38,896
Oh, you mean
those frauds?

886
00:36:38,897 --> 00:36:40,327
Duh!

887
00:36:40,332 --> 00:36:41,832
So, what do you...
What do you think?

888
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:43,503
Impressed? Hmm?

889
00:36:43,502 --> 00:36:44,632
You're insane.

890
00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:45,966
I know! It's...

891
00:36:45,971 --> 00:36:47,141
Don't you love it?

892
00:36:47,139 --> 00:36:48,469
I mean, of course you do.

893
00:36:48,473 --> 00:36:49,613
I mean, we're the same.

894
00:36:49,608 --> 00:36:52,138
Oh, we are not the same.

895
00:36:52,144 --> 00:36:53,744
Wait, wait, wait.

896
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:56,175
I-if you're worried,

897
00:36:56,181 --> 00:37:00,121
I've got the perfect person
to pin it on:

898
00:37:00,118 --> 00:37:01,648
That street preacher.

899
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:02,923
Genius, right?

900
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:04,191
Guy's crazy. Yeah.

901
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:05,719
And I already dropped
some evidence, so it's...

902
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:08,164
Whoa!

903
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,160
But I did this for you.

904
00:37:10,162 --> 00:37:11,162
Aren't you happy?

905
00:37:11,163 --> 00:37:13,233
Why would I be happy?

906
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:15,402
I'm not evil.
I punish evil.

907
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,630
Yeah, but, but you're,
you know...
The devil, yes.

908
00:37:16,635 --> 00:37:17,995
And you think you know
who that is, don't you?

909
00:37:18,003 --> 00:37:19,903
The whole world does.

910
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:22,305
A torturer, maybe.

911
00:37:22,307 --> 00:37:25,037
An inflictor of
just desserts, sure.

912
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:27,583
But a senseless murderer
I am not.

913
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:30,309
Perhaps I need to clarify
my position.

914
00:37:30,315 --> 00:37:31,715
Hey, hold on, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

915
00:37:31,717 --> 00:37:33,377
I've got this, remember?

916
00:37:33,385 --> 00:37:34,515
(laughs)

917
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:35,819
Don't worry, malcolm.

918
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:37,421
I'm not gonna send you to hell.

919
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:40,262
I'm going to bring it
right to you.

920
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:43,759
And after I'm finished with you,

921
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:45,202
Detective decker
can put you

922
00:37:45,197 --> 00:37:46,527
In a cold, dark room

923
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:48,501
So you can think about
what you've done, young man.

924
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,373
Oh...

925
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:52,400
(both laughing)

926
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,409
(whimpering)

927
00:37:56,408 --> 00:37:57,668
Ah!

928
00:37:57,676 --> 00:38:00,076
Amenadiel:
Why don't you pick on
someone your own size?

929
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,690
After the monumentally
dreadful day I've had,

930
00:38:15,694 --> 00:38:17,264
You decide to drop in now?

931
00:38:17,262 --> 00:38:18,562
I'm clearing up your mess,
by the way,

932
00:38:18,563 --> 00:38:19,703
So if you don't mind.

933
00:38:19,698 --> 00:38:21,698
You sent your demon to seduce me

934
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,100
And then kill me.

935
00:38:23,101 --> 00:38:25,101
(lucifer chuckles)
amenadiel:
Yeah.

936
00:38:25,103 --> 00:38:27,373
I definitely mind.

937
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,440
Right.

938
00:38:30,442 --> 00:38:31,312
Wonderful.

939
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:32,680
Now look what you've done.

940
00:38:32,678 --> 00:38:34,378
The man you just freed--

941
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:35,849
You know, the one
you raised from the dead--

942
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:37,047
He's murdering humans.

943
00:38:37,049 --> 00:38:40,749
And that... That is on
your hands, brother.

944
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:42,122
You're wrong.

945
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,550
It's your fault.

946
00:38:43,555 --> 00:38:44,745
Oh...

947
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:46,586
It always has been.

948
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:49,792
Hate to break it to you, bro...

949
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:53,102
...But this time,
I'm fighting back.

950
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:54,528
(grunting)

951
00:38:54,533 --> 00:38:56,903
If only you'd done
what was asked of you,

952
00:38:56,902 --> 00:38:58,132
None of this
would've happened,

953
00:38:58,136 --> 00:38:59,866
And I'd still be home...

954
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:01,141
(grunts)

955
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:02,269
...Where I belong!

956
00:39:02,274 --> 00:39:05,284
Heaven? Really?

957
00:39:05,277 --> 00:39:06,877
You're sure that's
still home, eh?

958
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:08,678
After everything you've done?

959
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:12,424
Sleeping with
a demon.

960
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:15,917
Think dad might have
another assignment for you.

961
00:39:15,921 --> 00:39:18,461
Somewhere, I don't know,
slightly warmer.

962
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,690
(yells)

963
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:28,027
Why?

964
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:29,933
Why did you have to use her?

965
00:39:29,935 --> 00:39:32,395
(laughs)

966
00:39:32,404 --> 00:39:35,474
Now I get what this little
tantrum's really about.

967
00:39:35,474 --> 00:39:37,274
It's about maze.

968
00:39:37,275 --> 00:39:38,835
You like her.

969
00:39:38,844 --> 00:39:41,244
Well, I mean,
I don't blame you, brother.

970
00:39:41,246 --> 00:39:43,776
She is a wild woman in the sack.

971
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,690
Listen, if you
wanted me dead,

972
00:39:50,689 --> 00:39:53,089
You should've had the balls
to do it yourself!

973
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:56,585
Oh, please.

974
00:39:56,595 --> 00:39:59,255
You're the one who's been
using pawns from the start.

975
00:39:59,264 --> 00:40:00,804
Linda, malcolm, huh?

976
00:40:00,799 --> 00:40:02,729
Now the detective.

977
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,235
You're a coward!
Chloe?

978
00:40:06,238 --> 00:40:08,938
I don't even know what
you're talking about!

979
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,810
You always were
a lousy liar.

980
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:18,153
You justify it all,
don't you?

981
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,320
Claim it's all done

982
00:40:19,317 --> 00:40:21,617
In the name of our father,

983
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,490
But...

984
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:26,058
It's for your sake, brother.

985
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:27,717
And they call me
the prideful one.

986
00:40:27,726 --> 00:40:30,226
Enough!

987
00:40:30,228 --> 00:40:32,358
I'm the pawn.

988
00:40:32,364 --> 00:40:35,304
You <i>both</i> used me.

989
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:38,744
You know what?

990
00:40:38,737 --> 00:40:39,737
Here.

991
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:43,739
Kill each other.

992
00:40:57,888 --> 00:40:59,688
(sighs)

993
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:03,555
Now where do I get a drink?

994
00:41:03,562 --> 00:41:05,962
The last place the preacher
was seen was near lux.

995
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:09,104
Remember, he's to be considered
armed and dangerous.

996
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,630
Malcolm took lucifer
into the club.

997
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:12,235
You guys see anything,
you get on the radio.

998
00:41:12,237 --> 00:41:13,267
All right, I'll check the club.

999
00:41:13,271 --> 00:41:14,571

â™ª

1001
00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:20,208
â™ª I was looking for you

1002
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:27,247
â™ª in all the right places
mmm.

1003
00:41:27,252 --> 00:41:29,452
Hello, detective.

1004
00:41:29,454 --> 00:41:31,294
If you've come to have a shot
at me, now's the time.

1005
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:33,489
Everyone's doing it.

1006
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:37,025
Yeah, your scuffle
with the preacher

1007
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:38,598
Made the local news.

1008
00:41:38,597 --> 00:41:39,597
(laughs)

1009
00:41:39,598 --> 00:41:40,798
Oh, that.

1010
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:43,129
That was about
five disasters ago.

1011
00:41:43,134 --> 00:41:45,204
God, your face...

1012
00:41:45,203 --> 00:41:46,443
Yeah, well, what can I say?

1013
00:41:46,438 --> 00:41:48,168
You should've seen
the other chap.

1014
00:41:48,173 --> 00:41:49,613
Thought I did.

1015
00:41:49,608 --> 00:41:50,738
What happened?

1016
00:41:50,742 --> 00:41:53,042
(scoffs)
well...

1017
00:41:53,044 --> 00:41:54,684
Where do I begin?

1018
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:58,519
With the grandest fall
in the history of time?

1019
00:41:58,517 --> 00:42:00,517
Or perhaps
the far more agonizing

1020
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:02,449
Punishment that followed?

1021
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,124
To be blamed for every

1022
00:42:05,123 --> 00:42:08,463
Morsel of evil
humanity's endured,

1023
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:11,230
Every atrocity
committed in my name?

1024
00:42:11,229 --> 00:42:13,399
â™ª trying to impress you

1025
00:42:13,398 --> 00:42:17,968
As though I wanted
people to suffer.

1026
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:20,299
All I ever wanted

1027
00:42:20,305 --> 00:42:22,705
Was to be my own man here.

1028
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:25,677
To be judged for my own doing.

1029
00:42:25,677 --> 00:42:26,977
And for that?

1030
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:30,445
I've been shown
how truly powerless I am.

1031
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:34,349
That even the people I trusted--

1032
00:42:34,352 --> 00:42:36,352
The one person, you--

1033
00:42:36,354 --> 00:42:38,964
(sighs sadly)

1034
00:42:38,957 --> 00:42:40,957
Could be used to hurt me.

1035
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:42,959
Lucifer...

1036
00:42:42,961 --> 00:42:45,261
Yes?

1037
00:42:51,268 --> 00:42:53,368
(laughing):
What?

1038
00:42:53,371 --> 00:42:55,311
Put your hands up
and move away from the bar.

1039
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:02,978
Detective,
there's an explanation...

1040
00:43:02,981 --> 00:43:03,981
Stop!

1041
00:43:03,982 --> 00:43:05,052
Don't say another word.

1042
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:06,050
Put your hands up.

1043
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:10,392
Or you'll leave
us no choice.

1044
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:14,859

Morningstar, you're under arrest.

31
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:09,351
Come on, Detective.

32
00:01:09,386 --> 00:01:12,187
You can't seriously believe I killed

33
00:01:12,223 --> 00:01:13,956
that pathetic malcontent.

34
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:16,158
It doesn't matter what I believe.

35
00:01:19,363 --> 00:01:21,563
That's all that matters, Detective.

36
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:26,235
Put your hands in the
air and surrender yourself.

00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:36,645
This isn't funny, Lucifer.

39
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,913
Isn't it?

40
00:01:37,948 --> 00:01:39,681
(laughs) I think

41
00:01:39,717 --> 00:01:43,118
this is the grandest joke that
I've heard in all my time.

42
00:01:43,154 --> 00:01:46,221

No.

47
00:01:54,498 --> 00:01:56,431
We won't.

48
00:01:56,467 --> 00:01:58,200

49
00:01:58,235 --> 00:02:01,136
I'm accepting my role in all of this.

50
00:02:01,172 --> 00:02:04,506
All of humanity's sins are
the Devil's fault, right?

51
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:06,708
I mean, I thought you knew
different, but I was wrong.

52
00:02:06,744 --> 00:02:09,011
You're just like all the others.

53
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:10,412
So,

54
00:02:10,447 --> 00:02:13,348
why not add one more murder to the pile?

55
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:14,783
That's not what this is, Lucifer.

56
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:15,884
Come on. What are you waiting for?

57
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,319
You wanted your bad
guy. Well, here he is,

00:02:17,354 --> 00:02:19,254
gift-wrapped just for you!

59
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,250

Newbie.

62
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,127
Come on. Riddle me with bullets,

63
00:02:25,162 --> 00:02:27,529
so you can go home, drink
an ice-cold beer,

64
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:29,698
and feel better about yourselves!

65
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,533
Don't shoot him. He's unarmed.

66
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:33,289
Oh, you don't know
that. Maybe I have a gun.

67
00:02:33,304 --> 00:02:34,102
Hands in the air!

68
00:02:34,138 --> 00:02:34,570
Do it!

69
00:02:34,605 --> 00:02:35,105
Don't!

70
00:02:37,374 --> 00:02:38,941
(panting)

71
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,676

(sighs)

74
00:02:49,186 --> 00:02:51,486
Search the area.

75
00:02:51,522 --> 00:02:54,523
He can't have gotten far.

76
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:00,729
(thunder rumbling)

77
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:03,865
(panting)

78
00:03:04,802 --> 00:03:06,702
Can we not tell anyone

79
00:03:06,737 --> 00:03:08,804
you just carried me in
your arms like a baby?

80
00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:10,572
What were you trying to
accomplish in there?

81
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:13,575
Uh, a good death?

82
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:15,577
Or at least a nice and messy one.

83
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:18,714
But then you had to come and
ruin everything, like always.

84
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,951
(groans)

85
00:03:22,987 --> 00:03:25,487
Why'd you swoop in and stop it?

86
00:03:25,522 --> 00:03:28,323
Wouldn't let someone else send
me to Hell, is that it?

87
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:31,793
Well, guess what,
brother, you don't need to kill me,

88
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:35,130
because I'm done here.

89
00:03:35,165 --> 00:03:37,399
I've had my fun on Earth, and...

90
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:39,234
(sighs)

91
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,803
there's no reason for
me to stay anymore.

92
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:43,672
You win.

93
00:03:43,707 --> 00:03:45,307
I'll go willingly.

94
00:03:45,342 --> 00:03:47,476
Please, just...

95
00:03:47,511 --> 00:03:49,444
take me back to Hell.

96
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,979
No.

97
00:03:51,015 --> 00:03:52,814
(sighs)

98
00:03:54,118 --> 00:03:56,251
(camera shutter clicking)

99
00:04:01,925 --> 00:04:04,693
Hey. What happened to Lucifer?

100
00:04:04,728 --> 00:04:06,695
You didn't hear?

101
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,397
What happened to him?

102
00:04:08,432 --> 00:04:10,265
He disappeared. He's on the run.

103
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:11,933
OFFICER: Ow.

104
00:04:14,805 --> 00:04:16,371
Let me see that.

105
00:04:16,407 --> 00:04:18,440
Have you ever seen a knife like this?

106
00:04:18,475 --> 00:04:21,310
Yeah. Uh, I'll take it to the station.

107
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:23,445
Careful. It's crazy sharp.

108
00:04:31,455 --> 00:04:33,422
Great.

109
00:04:33,457 --> 00:04:35,057
Hey.

110
00:04:35,092 --> 00:04:36,158
I need to talk to you.

111
00:04:38,962 --> 00:04:40,429
I know this is gonna sound crazy,

112
00:04:40,464 --> 00:04:41,763
especially after what just happened,

113
00:04:41,799 --> 00:04:43,999
but I think Lucifer is innocent.

114
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,601
Chloe, Lucifer got into
a fight with the deceased

115
00:04:46,637 --> 00:04:48,237
just a couple hours ago. We both saw it.

116
00:04:48,238 --> 00:04:49,604
I know. Just hear me out.

117
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,040
Okay? Just pretend you
don't know Lucifer.

118
00:04:52,076 --> 00:04:54,076
- I already like it.
- Our suspect

119
00:04:54,111 --> 00:04:56,445
is a club owner who likes to
tell people he's the Devil.

120
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,979
You're not really selling his innocence.

121
00:04:58,015 --> 00:05:01,249
He's a man who embraces
desire, lives by his passion.

122
00:05:01,285 --> 00:05:04,052
Now think about the
body. The guy was executed,

123
00:05:04,088 --> 00:05:05,587
single bullet to the head.

124
00:05:05,622 --> 00:05:08,056
There's no passion behind this.

125
00:05:08,092 --> 00:05:10,058
- This isn't him.
- Then it's a frame job.

126
00:05:10,094 --> 00:05:11,159
Who would want to set him up?

127
00:05:11,195 --> 00:05:13,261
- I don't know.
- OFFICER 2: Detective,

128
00:05:13,297 --> 00:05:14,896
we may have found the murder weapon.

129
00:05:14,932 --> 00:05:17,432
Okay. Test it for prints and DNA.

130
00:05:17,468 --> 00:05:19,634
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thanks.

131
00:05:21,705 --> 00:05:23,839
Lucifer's prints are
gonna be on that gun.

132
00:05:23,874 --> 00:05:25,507
- You don't know that.
- I do.

133
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:27,376
And I also know you're right.

134
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:28,877
Lucifer's innocent.

135
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,712
What?

136
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:33,215
Chloe, we have to talk.

137
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,350
Somewhere else.

138
00:05:36,687 --> 00:05:39,921
You don't want to take me back to Hell?

139
00:05:39,957 --> 00:05:43,625
The one bloody thing you've
wanted this entire time.

140
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,427
(chuckles) Did I punch you

141
00:05:45,462 --> 00:05:46,661
in the head too hard?

142
00:05:46,697 --> 00:05:48,730
Maze was right, Luci.

143
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:49,631
We used her.

144
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,733
And Malcolm. People have died

145
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:52,634
because of us.

146
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:54,069
Because of you, you mean.

147
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,104
Yes. Because of me.

148
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,139
Right.

149
00:05:59,176 --> 00:06:01,977
Brother, somehow I lost
sight of the bigger picture,

150
00:06:02,012 --> 00:06:03,578
of the cost of my actions,

151
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:06,114
and just how truly selfish they were.

152
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,483
But, Luci, my eyes are wide open now,

153
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,419
and I need to make this right.

154
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:11,987
Do you know, I think this
side of you's actually scarier

155
00:06:12,022 --> 00:06:13,021
than the angry one.

156
00:06:13,056 --> 00:06:14,623
I need to find Malcolm,

157
00:06:14,658 --> 00:06:16,591
and I need to send him back to Hell.

158
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:20,862
Will you help me, brother?

159
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:24,232
(sighs)

160
00:06:24,268 --> 00:06:27,469
One last bit of
punishment on the way out.

161
00:06:27,504 --> 00:06:29,037
(thunder rumbles)

162
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:31,840
It sounds like fun to me.

164
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,736
Ah, there's nothing like a
fresh shirt after a rainy rooftop.

165
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:48,106
What is that smell?

166
00:06:48,142 --> 00:06:50,676
(groans) Tropical musk candles.

167
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:54,079
Gosh, the sacrifices you
made pretending to be a therapist.

168
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:55,147
Yeah, I like that scent.

169
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:56,815
- Of course you do.
- Okay,

170
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,684
can we please just focus?

171
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:00,364
Now, what's your plan to find Malcolm?

172
00:07:00,365 --> 00:07:01,153
My plan?

173
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:02,427
- Yeah.
- Well, I thought you were

174
00:07:02,452 --> 00:07:03,789
the expert at plotting murder.

175
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:06,258
Or not so expert, considering
I'm still alive.

176
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:07,593
Which is why I brought us here,

177
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:08,994
so that we could come up with a plan.

178
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,495
Right. Well, it sounds
more like you want me

179
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:13,565
to do all the heavy
lifting. So how's this? Step one,

180
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:15,901
travel back in time and
not make such a mess of things.

181
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,769
You know, I'm suddenly
reminded of why I wanted you dead

182
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:18,837
in the first place.

183
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:20,322
Luci, what is your problem?

184
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:22,407
Oh, good question,
Doctor. Well, you see,

185
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:25,611
the thing is that my
brother has been trying to kill me

186
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:27,145
and now he wants to work with me

187
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:28,280
but we can't seem to get along,

188
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:29,915
mainly because he's an egotistical twit.

189
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:30,916
Hello?

190
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,251
Oh, I'm sorry,

191
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:34,620
Dr. Canaan. I didn't
realize that you were in session

192
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,188
with a... Lucifer?

193
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:38,657
(scoffing) Oh.

194
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:40,325
I can't believe this.

195
00:07:40,361 --> 00:07:42,494
You're stealing my patient.

196
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:45,163
Uh, not exactly.

197
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,533
Actually, you may be just what
we need, my dear doctor.

198
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:55,440
I deserve that.

199
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:56,875
You lied to me.

200
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,343
I don't even know you.

201
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:00,279
You shot a man in cold blood.

202
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:01,913
I shot Malcolm to protect you.

203
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:05,550
Everything I saw at
Palmetto, it was all true!

204
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:07,452
You let them think I was crazy.

205
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:09,521
- I never intended...
- You let me think I was crazy.

206
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:10,689
I'm sorry.

207
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:12,824
You don't get to be sorry.

208
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,300
If I could take it all back, I would.

209
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:15,827
You can't take it back!

210
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:17,929
I know.

211
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:21,300
But you can make this right.

212
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:24,169
How?

213
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:26,238
Prove Lucifer is innocent.

214
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:29,374
Where are you going?

215
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,376
Lucifer thinks I abandoned him.

216
00:08:31,412 --> 00:08:33,512
I need to find him.

217
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:38,717
LINDA: So you're-you're brothers?

218
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:40,719
Unfortunately.

219
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:42,816
LUCIFER: And we're having a terrible
time working together.

220
00:08:42,817 --> 00:08:45,057
But because you've been so
helpful with me, Linda,

221
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:46,825
hopefully you can help fix our problems.

222
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,727
Listen, I know this must be a shock...

223
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:49,995
Are you even a real doctor?

224
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,997
(laughing) No, of course he isn't.

225
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,466
Gosh, if he had any
clue about human nature,

226
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:55,500
we wouldn't be in this mess.

227
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:57,769
Oh. You dare criticize me?

228
00:08:57,805 --> 00:08:59,171
Luci, you're arrogant,

229
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:00,060
you're selfish, all you do is

230
00:09:00,085 --> 00:09:00,972
- think with your penis...
- Oh.

231
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:02,974
LUCIFER: Oh. Which, of
course, you would never do, would you?

232
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,109
How's Maze, by the way?

233
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:05,877
Dr. Martin, will you please
tell him to shut up

234
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:07,045
and just listen to reason?

235
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:09,281
Oh, if by reason, you
mean a deceptive load

236
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:10,349
- of bull...
- Enough!

237
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:14,553
You lied to me about being a doctor

238
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:16,121
so you could manipulate Lucifer,

239
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:17,889
who is actually

240
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:19,424
your brother.

241
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,759
Somehow.

242
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:22,994
Do you realize

243
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,030
the ethical position you've put me in?

244
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,031
(chuckles)

245
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,999
And you, let me guess,

246
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:29,167
you were gonna make a sexual joke

247
00:09:29,203 --> 00:09:30,369
about putting me in a position.

248
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:32,371
That's true, yeah.

249
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,306
Because everything's a joke to you.

250
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:37,242
And yet, for some
reason, I take you seriously,

251
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:41,246
even when you insist on
clinging to these ridiculous metaphors...

252
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:43,482
Heaven, Hell, angels, devils.

253
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:44,750
- Actually, they're not...
- Trust me,

254
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:45,951
you don't want to pick that fight.

255
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:47,586
You claimed you came to L.A.

256
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:49,187
to reinvent yourself, yet every time

257
00:09:49,223 --> 00:09:52,691
I think you come upon a
moment of realization,

258
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:55,494
you go the exact
wrong direction with it.

259
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:57,562
I did... Ho-Hold on. You're
right. I did come to L.A.

260
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,030
to start a new life, didn't I?

261
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:01,900
And now Malcolm's on the run.

262
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,295
He's gonna need to
start a new life, too.

263
00:10:04,445 --> 00:10:06,638
- No, see, you're doing it again.
- LUCIFER: New I.D.,

264
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:07,873
bank account, passport.

265
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:10,609
I know just the person to go to.

266
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:12,411
Oh.

267
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,479
Damn, you're good.

268
00:10:14,515 --> 00:10:16,081
- Yep.
- (door shuts)

269
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:22,187
(Chloe clears throat)

270
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,527
Where's Lucifer?

271
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:32,097
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.

272
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:37,302
You've never liked me.

273
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:38,670
Why?

274
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:40,839
Because every day was a party.

275
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:43,675
Every sin, every desire L.A. offered,

276
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,844
we took part.

277
00:10:47,281 --> 00:10:49,214
And then he met you.

278
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,783
So you think it's my
fault that the party's over?

279
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:55,687
That and the fact that
you're hunting him down like a dog.

280
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:59,124
I don't think he killed the preacher.

281
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,993
I need you to help me find
him before another cop does.

282
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:03,795
So where would he go?

283
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:05,564
- You know him better than anyone.
- These days

284
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,399
it seems you know him better than I do.

285
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:10,402
So where do you think he's going?

286
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:13,738
To get punishment.

287
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,808
Which means he's going after Malcolm.

288
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:19,344
Then maybe he hasn't
changed that much after all.

289
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,746
If he gets to Malcolm first,

290
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:23,949
he really will go down for murder.

291
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,423
You can't come with me.

292
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,025
You said you needed my
help finding him, right?

293
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:36,428
I don't see anybody else backing you up.

294
00:11:45,606 --> 00:11:48,206
Byron was a nice guy, a handy guy.

295
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:50,175
He fixed my toaster once.

296
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,111
Not a BLT goes by I
don't think of Byron.

297
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:54,946
LUCIFER: Excuse me!

298
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:57,182
Yeah, sorry to
interrupt the riveting eulogy,

299
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,017
but I'm here to see
the funeral director.

300
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,253
Hello, Neil. Remember me?

301
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:02,420
In a bit of a rush,

302
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:03,922
unfortunately.

303
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:07,392
Whereas this poor chap, well,
he's not going anywhere, is he?

304
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:10,362
Sir, please wait until
after we're finished.

305
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:11,863
This is disrespectful.

306
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:14,266
Uh, no, this is disrespectful.

307
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:16,835
I mean, this whole
show... who's it for, really?

308
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,270
Eh? Not him.

309
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:20,438
He's not hearing any of this.

310
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:22,240
Would you back me up, please, bro?

311
00:12:22,276 --> 00:12:24,042
He is right.

312
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,011
See? Trust me, he should know.

313
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:27,479
No, it's for you, isn't it?

314
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:28,847
It's a selfish way

315
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:31,383
for you to all feel better about
yourselves about how much

316
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:34,019
you ignored this poor sod in life.

317
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:36,588
Oh, did you choose this suit?

318
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:38,290
Mr. Morningstar, this way.

319
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:40,025
Oh, you do remember me?

320
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,980
Feel free to carry on.

321
00:12:42,923 --> 00:12:45,530
You have no right disrupting
this funeral.

322
00:12:45,566 --> 00:12:46,634
- This is my business.
- Yes.

323
00:12:46,635 --> 00:12:48,012
Your least profitable one.

324
00:12:48,172 --> 00:12:50,502
Your main source of income
is creating new identities,

325
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:52,571
which is why I came to
you five years ago to get

326
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:53,806
my proper papers and all that.

327
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:55,907
And I did great work
for you, Mr. Morningstar.

328
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:58,610
- So why are you doing this?
- Well, if I know you're the best,

329
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:00,245
then Malcolm Graham does, as well.

330
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,713
(sighs) The cop.

331
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:04,583
- Yeah.
- Yeah, he needed it to be done fast,

332
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:06,985
but said he'd need time to
get his hands on the 100K.

333
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,621
Where would a homicide
detective get that kind of money quickly?

334
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:11,122
Mm, look at you, Sherlock.

335
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:13,592
(sighs) He mentioned an old associate.

336
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:14,993
Tommy, I think.

337
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:16,628
Great. We'll do a search

338
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:18,229
for every "Tommy" in Los Angeles.

339
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:19,598
What's another thousand years?

340
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:22,133
No, no, no, no. An old
associate of Malcolm's, you say?

341
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:25,236
I think I might know just
the person who can help us.

342
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:27,005
Rhymes with "douche."

343
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,807
Thanks, Neil.

344
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,946
I wish I had my knives.

345
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:36,081
You're not gonna need 'em.

346
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:38,249
I never need them.

347
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:42,954
LAPD! Malcolm, if...

348
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,327
Oh.

349
00:13:49,363 --> 00:13:50,428
Hello?

350
00:13:50,464 --> 00:13:52,964
Anyone here?

351
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,200
(scoffs)

352
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:57,335
Looks like Malcolm likes to shop.

353
00:13:57,371 --> 00:13:59,604
You cops must make a lot of money.

354
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,473
You hiring?

355
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,375
We're not, and we don't.

356
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:06,111
I have no idea how he
can afford all this stuff.

357
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:09,247
Well, if you don't make good
money, why do you do this job?

358
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:10,448
'Cause I get to shoot people,

359
00:14:10,484 --> 00:14:12,164
which is something you
should keep in mind.

360
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,720
(laughs) No really. Why?

361
00:14:15,756 --> 00:14:18,790
'Cause I hate it when people
get away with things they shouldn't.

362
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:20,925
And you like to shoot people.

363
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:22,360
Yeah.

364
00:14:22,396 --> 00:14:24,295
Huh.

365
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:27,565
And to think I almost killed
you in your sleep that one time.

366
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:28,700
Wait. What?

367
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:29,734
(door creaks open)

368
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,903
(gun clicking)

369
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:34,372
(gunshot)

370
00:14:34,408 --> 00:14:35,774
(panting)

371
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:39,277
Oh, now I know why he
likes working with you.

372
00:14:49,943 --> 00:14:51,776
Malcolm, it's the police!

373
00:14:51,811 --> 00:14:53,778
Stop firing and put the gun down!

374
00:14:53,813 --> 00:14:55,747
WOMAN: He's not with you?

375
00:14:57,918 --> 00:15:00,718
Please tell me he's not with you.

376
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:08,793
Sorry. I thought you were my husband.

377
00:15:08,828 --> 00:15:10,862
Mel, why were you shooting at Malcolm?

378
00:15:10,897 --> 00:15:12,497
Ever since he almost died, he...

379
00:15:12,532 --> 00:15:15,266
he's been different, he's been strange.

380
00:15:15,302 --> 00:15:16,868
I can't describe it.

381
00:15:16,903 --> 00:15:18,536
He has a newfound appetite.

382
00:15:18,572 --> 00:15:20,305
An insatiable hunger

383
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,973
he just can't seem to fill.

384
00:15:22,008 --> 00:15:23,241
How do you know?

385
00:15:23,276 --> 00:15:24,809
I've seen it before.

386
00:15:24,844 --> 00:15:25,944
Where?

387
00:15:25,979 --> 00:15:28,346
Right. I forgot who I was talking to.

388
00:15:28,381 --> 00:15:29,681
It only gets worse.

389
00:15:29,716 --> 00:15:30,782
It can't get worse!

390
00:15:30,817 --> 00:15:32,317
He spent all our money.

391
00:15:32,352 --> 00:15:33,952
And when I saw him today, he...

392
00:15:33,987 --> 00:15:35,420
Wait. When did he come by today?

393
00:15:35,455 --> 00:15:37,221
You just missed him.

394
00:15:37,257 --> 00:15:39,857
He was frantic. He was
looking for money, and he was angry.

395
00:15:39,893 --> 00:15:41,225
He was so angry.

396
00:15:41,261 --> 00:15:43,962
And he had this look in his
eye, and he said things like...

397
00:15:43,997 --> 00:15:46,464
Do you have any idea where
he might have gone?

398
00:15:46,499 --> 00:15:48,232
(scoffs)

399
00:15:48,268 --> 00:15:50,001
He said he was gonna go get a beer.

400
00:15:50,036 --> 00:15:51,769
- (phone buzzing)
- Okay.

401
00:15:51,805 --> 00:15:54,639
Thanks. Excuse me.

402
00:15:54,674 --> 00:15:56,441
Malcolm's good, Chloe.

403
00:15:56,476 --> 00:15:58,977
I can't find any
evidence tying him to the murders.

404
00:15:59,012 --> 00:16:00,278
How's it going on your end?

405
00:16:00,313 --> 00:16:02,447
Malcolm's not home. Mel
said he went out for a beer.

406
00:16:02,482 --> 00:16:03,762
Does that make any sense to you?

407
00:16:03,783 --> 00:16:05,383
No. When I saw him, he was scared.

408
00:16:05,418 --> 00:16:07,151
I think he knows Lucifer's
gonna come after him.

409
00:16:07,187 --> 00:16:08,987
He looked like a guy
getting ready to run.

410
00:16:09,022 --> 00:16:10,622
Yeah, well, he doesn't
have the money to get far.

411
00:16:10,657 --> 00:16:12,690
Yeah, but he's the kind of
guy who'd know how to find it.

412
00:16:12,726 --> 00:16:14,892
Oh, maybe there's a
bar that owes him money.

413
00:16:14,928 --> 00:16:17,528
Yeah, or one that he could
rob for some extra cash.

414
00:16:17,564 --> 00:16:19,864
I'll look into it.

415
00:16:23,703 --> 00:16:26,971
(door squeaks open and shut)

416
00:16:27,007 --> 00:16:29,707
Don't move, or wobbly head gets it.

417
00:16:29,743 --> 00:16:31,209
How did you get in here?

418
00:16:31,244 --> 00:16:32,677
There's a manhunt for you.

419
00:16:32,712 --> 00:16:34,245
And this is the last
place you'd look, isn't it?

420
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,440
I thought it was quite clever.

421
00:16:35,448 --> 00:16:36,514
Ooh.

422
00:16:36,549 --> 00:16:38,383
You need to get the hell out of here.

423
00:16:38,418 --> 00:16:40,138
Oh, we're gonna need some
information first.

424
00:16:40,153 --> 00:16:41,686
- Who are you?
- LUCIFER: Not this again.

425
00:16:41,721 --> 00:16:44,188
He's my brother. I
know, shocking, isn't it?

426
00:16:44,224 --> 00:16:45,757
He's much less handsome than I am.

427
00:16:45,792 --> 00:16:47,358
AMENADIEL: We're
looking for Malcolm, Detective.

428
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:49,594
Now, we've been told that he's
seeing an associate named Tommy?

429
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:53,031
There are a lot of Tommys in...

430
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,367
A beer. Of course.

431
00:16:56,403 --> 00:16:58,670
We'd very much like to
know what you just realized.

432
00:16:58,705 --> 00:17:00,171
Too bad. I'm not telling you.

433
00:17:00,206 --> 00:17:02,707
(laughs) But you want
to, though, don't you?

434
00:17:02,742 --> 00:17:04,842
No, I don't.

435
00:17:04,878 --> 00:17:08,379
Oh, you're a complicated
one. That is a surprise.

436
00:17:08,415 --> 00:17:11,749
So, come on, what do you
want to do, Daniel? Hmm?

437
00:17:11,785 --> 00:17:13,885
I...

438
00:17:14,754 --> 00:17:16,621
I want to redeem myself.

439
00:17:16,656 --> 00:17:19,991
Oh. And taking down
Malcolm would do that, wouldn't it?

440
00:17:20,026 --> 00:17:21,793
So where is he?

441
00:17:21,828 --> 00:17:23,027
Come on, you can tell us.

442
00:17:23,063 --> 00:17:24,862
Like you said, we're
surrounded by police.

443
00:17:24,898 --> 00:17:27,165
There's an old brewery on Third.

444
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,599
Mm-hmm.

445
00:17:28,635 --> 00:17:31,102
A drug dealer named Tommy Campolongo
works out of there.

446
00:17:31,137 --> 00:17:33,738
Ah. Not that complicated after all.

447
00:17:33,773 --> 00:17:36,908
So you two will stay in
a holding cell while I...

448
00:17:36,943 --> 00:17:39,277
(whooshing)

449
00:17:45,318 --> 00:17:47,185
Okay. Tommy Campolongo.

450
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,554
That makes sense, that
he'd have cash on him.

451
00:17:49,589 --> 00:17:51,756
But he's not gonna hand it over nicely.

452
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:52,951
I'm leaving the precinct now.

453
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:54,625
Okay, meet me there with
backup. I'm not far.

454
00:17:54,661 --> 00:17:56,794
Chloe, don't go...

455
00:17:57,664 --> 00:17:59,397
Damn it.

456
00:18:02,936 --> 00:18:04,936
MAN: You like that?

457
00:18:04,971 --> 00:18:07,205
(laughing)

458
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,908
And to think, after all this time,

459
00:18:10,944 --> 00:18:12,744
I just thought you were dead.

460
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:14,812
What can I say?

461
00:18:14,848 --> 00:18:16,948
It's hard to keep a good man down.

462
00:18:16,983 --> 00:18:19,283
- Mm-hmm.
- And now

463
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:21,219
I'm ready to get the
old band back together.

464
00:18:21,254 --> 00:18:23,354
You have some product you can move?

465
00:18:23,389 --> 00:18:24,989
We've got some seizures

466
00:18:25,024 --> 00:18:26,457
just sitting there in evidence.

467
00:18:26,493 --> 00:18:30,795
Could actually get you a
supply today if you've got cash.

468
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,797
I always have cash, Malcolm.

469
00:18:32,832 --> 00:18:34,132
You know that.

470
00:18:34,167 --> 00:18:36,100
That I do, Tommy.

471
00:18:36,136 --> 00:18:38,136
That I do.

472
00:18:38,171 --> 00:18:39,871
How much you thinking?

473
00:18:39,906 --> 00:18:41,139
How much you got?

474
00:18:41,174 --> 00:18:43,608
(laughing)

475
00:18:43,643 --> 00:18:45,309
(imitating laughter)

476
00:18:45,345 --> 00:18:47,678
(clattering)

477
00:18:47,714 --> 00:18:51,282
What's going on up there?

478
00:18:54,354 --> 00:18:56,921
This ain't me.

479
00:18:58,691 --> 00:19:00,158
What you waiting for?!

480
00:19:06,132 --> 00:19:07,965
But hey.

481
00:19:08,001 --> 00:19:11,335
Gift horse and all that... am I right?

482
00:19:13,139 --> 00:19:16,340
Why don't you go ahead, open
up that safe, my man?

483
00:19:21,447 --> 00:19:22,947
Oh...

484
00:19:22,982 --> 00:19:24,749
hello there.

485
00:19:24,784 --> 00:19:26,450
If you miscreants don't mind,

486
00:19:26,486 --> 00:19:28,152
we're looking for Malcolm Graham.

487
00:19:28,188 --> 00:19:29,687
Hand him over, and we
all can be on our way

488
00:19:29,722 --> 00:19:31,355
without too much fuss.

489
00:19:31,391 --> 00:19:33,624
You two made a huge
mistake walking in here.

490
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,426
(guns clicking)

491
00:19:35,461 --> 00:19:37,228
(stammers)

492
00:19:38,698 --> 00:19:41,232
What do you say we skip the
time-slowing shenanigans, hmm?

493
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:43,334
What about your mortality situation?

494
00:19:43,369 --> 00:19:45,469
Well, it's kind of a non-sitch
when the detective's not around.

495
00:19:45,505 --> 00:19:47,138
I'll explain later, but for now,

496
00:19:47,173 --> 00:19:50,274
we'll just, you know, enjoy the moment.

497
00:19:55,782 --> 00:19:57,949
(chuckles) After you.

498
00:19:57,984 --> 00:19:59,483
Lovely.

499
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:02,053
Right, I should warn you...

500
00:20:02,088 --> 00:20:03,855
(grunts)

501
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:07,458
(sighs) This is hardly a fair fight.

502
00:20:07,493 --> 00:20:08,693
d Hey, hey... d

503
00:20:08,728 --> 00:20:11,596
(gunshots)

504
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,734
d Hey, hey now d

505
00:20:16,769 --> 00:20:19,437
d Hey, hey now d

506
00:20:20,907 --> 00:20:23,441
(shouts)

507
00:20:23,476 --> 00:20:26,777
d Hey, hey, there's a fire
and it's running, coming in here d

508
00:20:26,813 --> 00:20:28,880
(grunting)

509
00:20:28,915 --> 00:20:32,083
d Hey, hey now, hey, hey now d

510
00:20:32,118 --> 00:20:34,452
d Hey, hey d

511
00:20:34,487 --> 00:20:37,054
d Hey, hey now... d

512
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:39,123
Sorry, bro. Genuine mistake.

513
00:20:39,158 --> 00:20:41,959
d Yeah, hey, hey
now, burning out of luck d

514
00:20:41,995 --> 00:20:43,995
d Gonna wear the crown d

515
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:48,799
d Hey, hey now, things
are burning up... d

516
00:20:48,835 --> 00:20:49,767
(gun clicks)

517
00:20:49,802 --> 00:20:51,102
Oh, do you need some help with that?

518
00:20:51,137 --> 00:20:52,737
d Things are burning up... d

519
00:20:52,772 --> 00:20:54,071
(screams)

520
00:20:54,107 --> 00:20:55,940
d Oh, oh, oh. d

521
00:20:55,975 --> 00:20:57,475
(both laugh)

522
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,277
And to think, we
wasted all that millennia

523
00:20:59,312 --> 00:21:00,978
fighting each other, right?

524
00:21:02,649 --> 00:21:04,315
We still need to find Malcolm.

525
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,549
Absolutely.

526
00:21:05,585 --> 00:21:08,219
You know, if we split
up, we'll cover more ground.

527
00:21:08,254 --> 00:21:09,754
Okay, but no hogging all the fun

528
00:21:09,789 --> 00:21:12,156
if you find him first... deal?

529
00:21:12,191 --> 00:21:13,224
Deal.

530
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:14,659
(man groaning)

531
00:21:14,694 --> 00:21:16,494
Oh!

532
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:19,230
(grunts)

533
00:21:38,051 --> 00:21:40,284
d d

534
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,299
(groaning)

535
00:21:55,335 --> 00:21:57,802
Wow. I mean,

536
00:21:57,837 --> 00:22:00,805
wow. I could tell it
was something special,

537
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,041
but I had no idea that was gonna work.

538
00:22:04,077 --> 00:22:05,810
(moaning)

539
00:22:05,845 --> 00:22:08,346
But you never know until you try.

540
00:22:09,282 --> 00:22:10,681
(groaning)

541
00:22:10,717 --> 00:22:12,183
Got to say,

542
00:22:12,218 --> 00:22:15,653
you don't look so scary now, Amenadude.

543
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:20,091
Oi!

544
00:22:20,126 --> 00:22:22,893
What part of "no
hogging" don't you understand?

545
00:22:22,929 --> 00:22:25,863
(groans, panting)

546
00:22:33,606 --> 00:22:35,740
(sighs) Bloody hell!

547
00:22:35,775 --> 00:22:36,907
There you go, spoiling

548
00:22:36,943 --> 00:22:38,743
my fun again.

549
00:22:38,778 --> 00:22:41,345
Leave me, and go get him.

550
00:22:41,381 --> 00:22:43,280
You know how much I hate
being in anyone's debt.

551
00:22:43,316 --> 00:22:46,350
I figure if I save you
now, that makes us even, right?

552
00:22:46,386 --> 00:22:48,419
Besides, it's...

553
00:22:48,454 --> 00:22:50,054
it's just a flesh wound.

554
00:22:50,089 --> 00:22:52,056
Hardly can see what
you're whining about.

555
00:22:52,091 --> 00:22:54,558
(panting)

556
00:22:55,495 --> 00:22:57,361
What happened?

557
00:22:57,397 --> 00:23:00,364
He was struck with a
blade not of this world, Maze.

558
00:23:01,768 --> 00:23:03,734
One of mine.

559
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:04,935
Yes.

560
00:23:04,971 --> 00:23:06,470
I'll handle this.

561
00:23:06,506 --> 00:23:07,571
How?

562
00:23:08,474 --> 00:23:10,007
Find him.

563
00:23:12,445 --> 00:23:14,578
With pleasure.

564
00:23:23,456 --> 00:23:25,589
(clattering)

565
00:23:26,826 --> 00:23:28,859
Malcolm, freeze!

566
00:23:30,663 --> 00:23:32,163
Stop!

567
00:23:32,198 --> 00:23:33,464
(gunshots)

568
00:23:33,499 --> 00:23:36,267
(panting)

569
00:23:57,223 --> 00:23:58,689
(gun clicks)

570
00:23:58,724 --> 00:24:00,157
Don't move.

571
00:24:06,913 --> 00:24:09,433
Easy, Detective.

572
00:24:09,468 --> 00:24:11,568
You're a hard man to find.

573
00:24:11,603 --> 00:24:14,104
Look, I know you think I'm a bad guy,

574
00:24:14,139 --> 00:24:16,606
but I'm simply trying to
catch our dear friend Malcolm

575
00:24:16,642 --> 00:24:18,493
so I can tear his arms and legs off.

576
00:24:18,814 --> 00:24:22,345
- This has nothing to do with you.
- You know I can't let you do that.

577
00:24:22,381 --> 00:24:25,148
(sighs) You don't know what he's done.

578
00:24:25,184 --> 00:24:27,084
You'd never believe me anyway.

579
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:29,419
But all you need to know is
that he's here to get money

580
00:24:29,455 --> 00:24:32,122
and then he's gonna disappear. For good.

581
00:24:33,025 --> 00:24:34,891
You mean this money?

582
00:24:36,128 --> 00:24:38,462
I'm not here to arrest you, Lucifer.

583
00:24:38,497 --> 00:24:39,996
I know you're innocent.

584
00:24:40,032 --> 00:24:41,698
I always have.

585
00:24:43,402 --> 00:24:44,935
So let's catch this bastard together

586
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,937
and put an end to all this.

587
00:24:49,508 --> 00:24:53,210
Ah. Look at us,
reunited, and it feels so good.

588
00:24:53,245 --> 00:24:55,912
Malcolm won't get far without
his getaway cash.

589
00:24:55,948 --> 00:24:57,314
Where's Maze?

590
00:24:57,349 --> 00:24:58,749
She's taking care
of something important.

591
00:24:58,774 --> 00:25:01,752
Oh, of course your ninja
bartender is off on a secret mission.

592
00:25:01,787 --> 00:25:03,019
Why, Detective, are you pining

593
00:25:03,055 --> 00:25:05,222
- for some good cop/demon copop action?
- No.

594
00:25:05,257 --> 00:25:06,914
I just want to clear
your name and find Malcolm.

595
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:07,624
No, no, no, no, no.

596
00:25:07,659 --> 00:25:09,259
Who cares about the Devil's rap sheet?

597
00:25:09,294 --> 00:25:10,861
Why don't we just skip that part

598
00:25:10,896 --> 00:25:12,596
and go straight to the main course?

599
00:25:12,631 --> 00:25:15,400
Because it's incredibly impulsive
and shortsighted.

600
00:25:15,401 --> 00:25:16,833
Have you noticed that's my jam?

601
00:25:16,869 --> 00:25:18,435
If we fix your reputation,

602
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,437
we'll preserve everything we've done.

603
00:25:20,472 --> 00:25:21,872
You want to keep working with me.

604
00:25:21,907 --> 00:25:24,441
- And to do that, you need to trust me.
- (door opens)

605
00:25:24,476 --> 00:25:26,610
- (sighs)
- (indistinct police transmission)

606
00:25:30,582 --> 00:25:32,816
- Okay. Well.
- Right. Very well, Detective.

607
00:25:32,851 --> 00:25:35,152
I'm in your hands. But how you intend

608
00:25:35,187 --> 00:25:36,953
to prove my innocence is beyond me.

609
00:25:36,989 --> 00:25:39,189
Put your hands down.

610
00:25:39,224 --> 00:25:40,824
We found the evidence we need.

611
00:25:40,859 --> 00:25:42,225
LUCIFER: He did?

612
00:25:42,261 --> 00:25:43,860
Can I rethink my surrender?

613
00:25:43,896 --> 00:25:44,961
What'd you find?

614
00:25:44,997 --> 00:25:48,131
It's better if I show you.

615
00:25:49,034 --> 00:25:51,701
(indistinct chatter)

616
00:25:51,737 --> 00:25:53,904
d d

617
00:25:53,939 --> 00:25:55,005
(moans)

618
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,408
(groans) Enough,

619
00:25:58,443 --> 00:25:59,709
Mazikeen.

620
00:25:59,745 --> 00:26:01,745
I've made my peace with death,

621
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,780
whether I go to Heaven or Hell.

622
00:26:03,816 --> 00:26:05,248
I know exactly where you're going.

623
00:26:05,284 --> 00:26:08,418
Nowhere. You're staying right here.

624
00:26:08,453 --> 00:26:10,187
Now shut up and let me help you.

625
00:26:12,591 --> 00:26:15,058
(gasps) There's nothing

626
00:26:15,093 --> 00:26:17,093
that you can do.

627
00:26:17,129 --> 00:26:20,297
It would take something
divine to heal me.

628
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:27,270
d I'm Hollywood... d

629
00:26:27,306 --> 00:26:29,003
You took that from Lucifer?

630
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:31,608
I kept it a secret.

631
00:26:31,643 --> 00:26:35,278
I thought I could use
it to get us back home.

632
00:26:35,314 --> 00:26:37,714
And you'd give that to me?

633
00:26:38,617 --> 00:26:40,617
Believe me,

634
00:26:40,652 --> 00:26:42,552
I don't understand this either.

635
00:26:42,588 --> 00:26:44,287
d We'll always be together d

636
00:26:44,323 --> 00:26:48,291

637
00:26:48,327 --> 00:26:49,693

640

d Forever. d

641
00:27:02,674 --> 00:27:06,676
(sighs) Why do I feel like
I'm walking death row?

642
00:27:06,712 --> 00:27:08,845
Should I order my final
meal now to save time?

643
00:27:08,881 --> 00:27:11,047
Dan says he has it handled.

644
00:27:11,083 --> 00:27:12,282
You do, right?

645
00:27:12,317 --> 00:27:15,418
I do.

646
00:27:16,788 --> 00:27:18,788
I'm here to turn myself in.

647
00:27:18,824 --> 00:27:20,857
What are you doing?

648
00:27:22,527 --> 00:27:24,494
I removed a firearm
from Evidence lockup,

649
00:27:24,529 --> 00:27:26,363
and I gave it to
Detective Malcolm Graham.

650
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:28,064
I believe Detective Graham

651
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,166
then used that weapon to
shoot and kill Jacob Williams,

652
00:27:30,202 --> 00:27:31,935
the crime that...

653
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:34,771
Mr. Morningstar is suspected of.

654
00:27:34,806 --> 00:27:36,439
Well,

655
00:27:36,475 --> 00:27:38,475
Detective Espinoza,

656
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,876
I...

657
00:27:39,912 --> 00:27:41,912
didn't know you had the stones.

658
00:27:42,814 --> 00:27:44,981
No more Detective Douche?

659
00:27:45,017 --> 00:27:46,950
Well, not today, at least.

660
00:27:46,985 --> 00:27:48,451
Let's go.

661
00:27:48,487 --> 00:27:50,553
Dan...

662
00:27:54,893 --> 00:27:56,526
(phone buzzing)

663
00:27:56,561 --> 00:27:58,929
(sighs)

664
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:03,833
I need to take this.

665
00:28:03,869 --> 00:28:06,803
Hey, honey. Everything okay?

666
00:28:06,838 --> 00:28:09,005
MALCOLM: Hello, Decker.

667
00:28:09,875 --> 00:28:11,341
Malcolm?

668
00:28:11,376 --> 00:28:12,809
How's the precinct?

669
00:28:14,613 --> 00:28:17,314
I still have a few
buddies at the stations.

670
00:28:17,349 --> 00:28:20,350
Oh, and I made a new friend today, too.

671
00:28:20,385 --> 00:28:23,687
Pulled her out of a boring
class for some bonding time.

672
00:28:23,722 --> 00:28:25,855
Here, say hi.

673
00:28:26,725 --> 00:28:29,025
Hi, Mommy.

674
00:28:35,303 --> 00:28:36,435
Hey, Trixie.

675
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:38,378
Are you okay, honey?

676
00:28:38,414 --> 00:28:39,413
Mommy's here.

677
00:28:39,448 --> 00:28:42,049
Uh, that's enough of that.

678
00:28:42,084 --> 00:28:44,451
(sighs) What do you want, Malcolm?

679
00:28:44,487 --> 00:28:47,120
Aw. Poor Chloe Decker.

680
00:28:47,156 --> 00:28:48,722
Did someone take something from you,

681
00:28:48,757 --> 00:28:50,324
something valuable?

682
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:51,925
Hurts, don't it?

683
00:28:52,795 --> 00:28:54,328
You want your money.

684
00:28:54,363 --> 00:28:55,829
Bull's-eye.

685
00:28:55,865 --> 00:28:58,565
Now, don't even think about talking
to the cops. Remember,

686
00:28:58,601 --> 00:29:00,467
- you don't know who's with me.
- Okay.

687
00:29:00,503 --> 00:29:02,736
And keep Lucifer out of this.

688
00:29:02,771 --> 00:29:04,905
Just you...

689
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,673
or she dies.

690
00:29:10,513 --> 00:29:13,981
d d

691
00:29:14,016 --> 00:29:18,318
d You're an unusual suspect
now and may be right d

692
00:29:18,354 --> 00:29:21,588
d The kind all men cannot recollect
or forget at night d

693
00:29:21,624 --> 00:29:25,359
d You're the rough
detective with the smokey eye d

694
00:29:25,394 --> 00:29:29,730
d Where the person you
are after is the other guy... d

695
00:29:29,765 --> 00:29:33,333
Hey. Um, I need the
duffel bag we seized today.

696
00:29:33,369 --> 00:29:34,501
Where is it? (clears throat)

697
00:29:34,537 --> 00:29:35,802
We were just about to
take it to Evidence.

698
00:29:35,838 --> 00:29:37,771
Okay. I need to examine it.

699
00:29:37,806 --> 00:29:39,339
Sure.

700
00:29:39,375 --> 00:29:41,508
LUCIFER: Ah,

701
00:29:41,544 --> 00:29:43,677
there you are.

702
00:29:43,712 --> 00:29:45,345
Is everything all right, Detective?

703
00:29:45,381 --> 00:29:46,680
Yeah.

704
00:29:46,715 --> 00:29:48,015
Of course.

705
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,816
I'll be right back.

706
00:29:49,852 --> 00:29:51,518
Right.

707
00:29:51,554 --> 00:29:55,856
d Well, I'm a rough
detective on a glory ride d

708
00:29:55,891 --> 00:30:00,093
d You keep going
faster so I slow down d

709
00:30:00,129 --> 00:30:01,628
d You hear me laughing d

710
00:30:01,664 --> 00:30:03,730
- d In the background d
- (siren whooping)

711
00:30:03,766 --> 00:30:05,399
(with American accent) Detective Decker,

712
00:30:05,434 --> 00:30:07,434
step away from your vehicle.

713
00:30:07,469 --> 00:30:09,503
Put your hands in the air

714
00:30:09,538 --> 00:30:12,272
and walk towards me peacefully.

715
00:30:12,308 --> 00:30:14,207
If you do not...

716
00:30:14,243 --> 00:30:16,176
I repeat... if you do not,

717
00:30:16,211 --> 00:30:18,779
we will have no choice but to shoot you

718
00:30:18,814 --> 00:30:21,114
with our new bazooka.

719
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:24,217
We've actually been waiting months
and months to use it, so,

720
00:30:24,253 --> 00:30:26,320
on second thought, please, speed away.

721
00:30:26,355 --> 00:30:27,654
What are you doing?

722
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:28,890
Well, I could ask you the s...

723
00:30:28,891 --> 00:30:29,923
(feedback squeals)

724
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:32,492
(normally) I could
ask you the same thing.

725
00:30:32,528 --> 00:30:35,028
You going somewhere without me, hmm?

726
00:30:35,064 --> 00:30:36,824
Right after all this
talk about trusting you,

727
00:30:36,832 --> 00:30:38,298
you're immediately keeping secrets?

728
00:30:38,334 --> 00:30:40,400
I don't have time to
explain to you. Something came up.

729
00:30:40,436 --> 00:30:43,089
Something that obviously requires
quite a bit of cash.

730
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:44,204
I didn't know you had
it in you, Detective.

731
00:30:44,239 --> 00:30:45,243
- It isn't for me.
- Oh, you're gonna make

732
00:30:45,268 --> 00:30:46,273
it rain at the local strip clubs then?

733
00:30:46,308 --> 00:30:48,775
- Lucifer...
- Or perhaps that phone call earlier

734
00:30:48,811 --> 00:30:50,877
wasn't as innocuous as
you made it out to be.

735
00:30:51,947 --> 00:30:53,547
Fine. You leave me no choice.

736
00:30:55,684 --> 00:30:57,651
Malcolm has Trixie.

737
00:30:59,388 --> 00:31:00,721
Oh.

738
00:31:00,756 --> 00:31:03,690
If I get him his
money, he'll let her go.

739
00:31:03,726 --> 00:31:05,792
Right. Because if
Malcolm's established anything,

740
00:31:05,828 --> 00:31:07,094
it's his trustworthiness.

741
00:31:07,129 --> 00:31:08,395
What choice do I have?

742
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:10,330
To ride shotgun with
the Devil, for starters.

743
00:31:10,366 --> 00:31:11,298
If Malcolm sees you,

744
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:12,399
he'll kill her. I'm sorry,

745
00:31:12,434 --> 00:31:14,134
but I can't risk
it... her life's at stake.

746
00:31:14,169 --> 00:31:15,048
Right. So you're just gonna get

747
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:16,069
both of you killed then, are you?

748
00:31:16,105 --> 00:31:17,871
He needs this money to leave town.

749
00:31:17,906 --> 00:31:20,107
I won't give it to him until she's safe.

750
00:31:20,142 --> 00:31:21,241
And what about your safety?

751
00:31:21,276 --> 00:31:22,743
Trixie is all that matters.

752
00:31:22,778 --> 00:31:23,800
- Detective, I...
- I don't have

753
00:31:23,825 --> 00:31:25,105
time to argue with you, Lucifer.

754
00:31:25,114 --> 00:31:29,116
I realize how bad this can
go, but I don't have a choice.

755
00:31:29,151 --> 00:31:31,284
This is my daughter.

756
00:31:33,122 --> 00:31:35,722
Promise me you'll let me go alone.

757
00:31:35,758 --> 00:31:37,791
Fine.

758
00:31:37,826 --> 00:31:39,326
You have my word.

759
00:31:39,361 --> 00:31:41,461
(sighs)

760
00:31:54,276 --> 00:31:55,909
Don't look so sad.

761
00:31:55,944 --> 00:31:57,744
Your mommy's coming to pick you up.

762
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,680
Good. I don't like you.

763
00:31:59,715 --> 00:32:01,615
What's not to like?

764
00:32:02,484 --> 00:32:04,885
(grunts)

765
00:32:06,922 --> 00:32:09,089
- Trixie.
- All right, easy, Decker.

766
00:32:09,124 --> 00:32:10,524
Easy.

767
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,726
Mommy, can we go home now?

768
00:32:12,761 --> 00:32:15,095
Yes, Monkey. (sniffles) We can.

769
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:17,798
Glad to see you came alone.

770
00:32:17,833 --> 00:32:20,600
Now toss the gun.

771
00:32:24,973 --> 00:32:27,107
(panting)

772
00:32:28,343 --> 00:32:29,810
Now the other one.

773
00:32:36,485 --> 00:32:38,418
There. You happy?

774
00:32:38,454 --> 00:32:40,420
Yeah, once I get my money, sure.

775
00:32:40,456 --> 00:32:42,355
So, where is it?

776
00:32:42,391 --> 00:32:44,391
Not without Trixie.

777
00:32:44,426 --> 00:32:47,294
- Oh, come on, Decker...
- Malcolm, that's the deal.

778
00:32:51,433 --> 00:32:52,799
Go on.

779
00:32:55,971 --> 00:32:57,804
Hi.

780
00:32:58,774 --> 00:32:59,773
Okay, listen to me.

781
00:32:59,808 --> 00:33:01,908
We're gonna play a game, all right?

782
00:33:01,944 --> 00:33:04,745
I need you to hide until
I can come find you.

783
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,379
Mommy, I don't want to play a game.

784
00:33:06,415 --> 00:33:07,748
- I know you don't, baby.
- (imitates gunshot)

785
00:33:07,783 --> 00:33:11,651
But I need you to go hide
really, really well, okay?

786
00:33:12,588 --> 00:33:14,488
Go.

787
00:33:14,523 --> 00:33:17,357
(chuckles) Kids, huh?

788
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:23,196
(sighs, coughs)

789
00:33:25,234 --> 00:33:27,000
It's there. It's-it's all there.

790
00:33:27,035 --> 00:33:28,201
It's in the bag.

791
00:33:28,237 --> 00:33:30,537
Yeah. I believe you.

792
00:33:32,608 --> 00:33:34,641
You don't need to do this, Malcolm.

793
00:33:34,676 --> 00:33:38,044
I know, but I was
gonna shoot you at Palmetto,

794
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,615
and now I feel like I've
been given a second chance here,

795
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:44,851
so I'm sure as hell not gonna waste it.

796
00:33:55,494 --> 00:33:57,828
LUCIFER: Is this really what you did

797
00:33:57,863 --> 00:34:00,731
with your second chance?

798
00:34:00,766 --> 00:34:02,266
Deary me, Malcolm. Pathetic.

799
00:34:02,301 --> 00:34:03,467
Hey, Lucifer.

800
00:34:03,502 --> 00:34:06,003
Hey, buddy. Long time no frame.

801
00:34:06,038 --> 00:34:08,472
Though that didn't stick
too well, did it?

802
00:34:08,507 --> 00:34:11,008
Guess I need to find a
more permanent solution.

803
00:34:11,043 --> 00:34:13,844
Give me the gun, Malcolm.

804
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:16,513
Why? Not afraid of you.

805
00:34:16,548 --> 00:34:18,148
All you're doing is
getting yourself killed.

806
00:34:18,183 --> 00:34:19,416
And for what?

807
00:34:19,451 --> 00:34:21,485
To buy your precious detective
some more time?

808
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,453
No.

809
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:25,222
No, I want to ask you a question.

810
00:34:25,257 --> 00:34:27,324
Oh. (chuckles softly)

811
00:34:29,028 --> 00:34:32,462
What do you desire, Malcolm?

812
00:34:35,067 --> 00:34:37,034
(whispering): Lucifer,
what are you doing?

813
00:34:37,069 --> 00:34:40,103
What do you yearn for in that...

814
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:42,005
rotten soul of yours?

815
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:44,841
I...

816
00:34:44,877 --> 00:34:46,910
You've been given a
second chance, Malcolm.

817
00:34:46,945 --> 00:34:48,378
Is killing Detective Decker

818
00:34:48,414 --> 00:34:50,080
really what you want to do with it?

819
00:34:52,051 --> 00:34:53,250
I don't.

820
00:34:53,285 --> 00:34:55,218
No, of course you don't.

821
00:34:55,254 --> 00:34:57,454
You want to live, don't you?

822
00:34:59,525 --> 00:35:00,891
I do.

823
00:35:02,294 --> 00:35:04,394
More than almost anything.

824
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:06,496
Almost?

825
00:35:07,433 --> 00:35:09,032
(gunshot)

826
00:35:10,135 --> 00:35:12,269
(gasping)

827
00:35:19,678 --> 00:35:21,211
There's one more thing.

828
00:35:36,946 --> 00:35:38,312
You feel that?

829
00:35:40,816 --> 00:35:42,650
That's what it's like to die, my man.

830
00:35:42,685 --> 00:35:44,652
I know, 'cause I've done it.

831
00:35:46,088 --> 00:35:49,690
And what I want, more than anything...

832
00:35:51,727 --> 00:35:55,296
is for you to feel that pain.

833
00:35:55,331 --> 00:35:56,797
To go through what I did.

834
00:35:58,968 --> 00:36:01,602
Because we both know
where you're going to.

835
00:36:06,409 --> 00:36:09,209
Bet you never expected

836
00:36:09,245 --> 00:36:10,711
to miss this thing so soon.

837
00:36:12,281 --> 00:36:13,514
Yeah.

838
00:36:13,549 --> 00:36:15,316
Don't worry.

839
00:36:15,351 --> 00:36:17,151
You won't be going alone.

840
00:36:17,186 --> 00:36:20,821
I'll be sending Decker
along right behind you.

841
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:24,224
Oh, Chloe...

842
00:36:26,595 --> 00:36:28,562
Oh, Decker...

843
00:36:28,597 --> 00:36:30,731
(coughing)

844
00:36:39,742 --> 00:36:42,810
Here, Chloe, Chloe, Chloe.

845
00:36:42,845 --> 00:36:44,578
<i>LUCIFER: I don't know if this is all</i>

846
00:36:44,613 --> 00:36:46,747
part of the plan.

847
00:36:48,017 --> 00:36:49,850
Or if You can even hear me.

848
00:36:53,456 --> 00:36:56,056
But if You're up there...

849
00:36:56,092 --> 00:36:57,925
Dad...

850
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,126
(laughs)

851
00:36:59,161 --> 00:37:02,463
I need a favor.

852
00:37:02,498 --> 00:37:04,631
(Lucifer gasping)

853
00:37:06,068 --> 00:37:07,534
<i>I'll be the son.</i>

854
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:09,837
<i>You always wanted me to be.</i>

855
00:37:09,872 --> 00:37:11,905
(Lucifer choking)

856
00:37:11,941 --> 00:37:14,408
I'll do as You ask. (heartbeat
echoing slowly)

857
00:37:14,443 --> 00:37:16,677
Go where You want me to.

858
00:37:16,712 --> 00:37:18,112
I...

859
00:37:19,715 --> 00:37:22,583
In exchange,

860
00:37:22,618 --> 00:37:27,254
all I ask is...

861
00:37:27,289 --> 00:37:30,357
is that you protect Chloe.

862
00:37:30,393 --> 00:37:31,692
(heartbeat stops)

863
00:37:36,165 --> 00:37:38,298
(ethereal choral music plays)

864
00:37:55,418 --> 00:37:57,518
(echoing) Home, sweet home.

865
00:37:57,553 --> 00:37:59,787
d d

866
00:38:12,468 --> 00:38:14,601
That can't be right.

867
00:38:17,673 --> 00:38:19,807
(clinking)

868
00:38:27,183 --> 00:38:29,917
It's open.

869
00:38:29,952 --> 00:38:31,952
(low rumbling)

870
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,027
This isn't possible.

871
00:38:41,464 --> 00:38:42,963
(gasps)

872
00:38:42,998 --> 00:38:45,132
(panting)

873
00:38:53,642 --> 00:38:55,843
(chuckles)

874
00:39:12,595 --> 00:39:14,361
Hello, Malkie.

875
00:39:33,015 --> 00:39:34,181
It doesn't matter.

876
00:39:34,216 --> 00:39:35,883
(snorting, choking)

877
00:39:35,918 --> 00:39:37,217
I've got your coin.

878
00:39:37,253 --> 00:39:38,719
Oh.

879
00:39:38,754 --> 00:39:40,888
I'll be back.

880
00:39:47,062 --> 00:39:49,029
You're looking for this?

881
00:39:49,064 --> 00:39:50,731
How...?

882
00:39:50,766 --> 00:39:52,900
I know a guy.

883
00:39:54,403 --> 00:39:56,870
Apparently, He wants me back here.

884
00:40:05,414 --> 00:40:07,514
(sighs)

885
00:40:08,918 --> 00:40:12,186
Sorry, pal.

886
00:40:13,556 --> 00:40:15,222
One use only.

887
00:40:30,072 --> 00:40:31,438
CHLOE: Trixie!

888
00:40:31,473 --> 00:40:33,907
Come out, honey!

889
00:40:33,943 --> 00:40:35,576
Mommy, is it over?

890
00:40:35,611 --> 00:40:37,811
Yeah, baby, it's over. Come here.

891
00:40:39,582 --> 00:40:41,014
Hi.

892
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:44,818
Oh, I'm so happy you're okay.

893
00:40:44,853 --> 00:40:47,020
Excuse me if I don't join the group hug.

894
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,193
(whispering) I thought he killed you.

895
00:40:53,229 --> 00:40:54,261
Oh, he did.

896
00:40:54,296 --> 00:40:55,429
Yes.

897
00:40:57,066 --> 00:40:58,865
I got better.

898
00:40:58,901 --> 00:41:01,101
Hmm.

899
00:41:01,136 --> 00:41:03,136
You promised you'd let me go alone.

900
00:41:03,172 --> 00:41:04,471
True.

901
00:41:04,506 --> 00:41:06,707
But I didn't say
anything about following.

902
00:41:09,011 --> 00:41:10,544
What's wrong?

903
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,313
(sighs)

904
00:41:13,349 --> 00:41:14,681
Isn't it past her bedtime?

905
00:41:20,089 --> 00:41:22,256
Hmm?

906
00:41:22,291 --> 00:41:24,625
(footsteps approaching)

907
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,793
(Lucifer sighs)

908
00:41:26,829 --> 00:41:29,930
(broken glass clinking)

909
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,673
LUCIFER: Ah!

910
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:41,842
Sleeping on the job?

911
00:41:43,012 --> 00:41:44,532
Luci, we still have to find Malcolm...

912
00:41:44,546 --> 00:41:45,812
Malcolm, yes.

913
00:41:45,848 --> 00:41:47,881
That's dealt with. It's
old news, really.

914
00:41:50,686 --> 00:41:52,686
(grunts)

915
00:41:52,721 --> 00:41:55,956
(sighs)

916
00:41:55,991 --> 00:41:57,090
Where's Maze?

917
00:41:57,126 --> 00:41:59,226
Well, I was gonna ask
you the same question.

918
00:41:59,261 --> 00:42:01,295
Perhaps your snoring drove her away.

919
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:02,429
(chuckles)

920
00:42:03,732 --> 00:42:07,134
(sighs)

921
00:42:07,169 --> 00:42:08,568
I spoke to Dad.

922
00:42:08,604 --> 00:42:10,337
Excuse me?

923
00:42:10,372 --> 00:42:13,707
Yeah. I offered Him my
services in exchange f...

924
00:42:13,742 --> 00:42:16,710
Well, that doesn't really matter.

925
00:42:16,745 --> 00:42:18,578
He accepted.

926
00:42:21,517 --> 00:42:22,983
He replied to you.

927
00:42:23,018 --> 00:42:24,184
Mmm.

928
00:42:24,219 --> 00:42:26,053
Well, not in words.

929
00:42:26,088 --> 00:42:27,387
But His message was clear.

930
00:42:27,423 --> 00:42:29,256
And what does Father want?

931
00:42:30,626 --> 00:42:32,192
Someone's escaped from Hell.

932
00:42:34,129 --> 00:42:36,263
Must've seen a window of opportunity

933
00:42:36,298 --> 00:42:38,198
whilst you were incapacitated.

934
00:42:38,233 --> 00:42:39,666
I think He wants me to bring

935
00:42:39,702 --> 00:42:41,068
our jailbird back.

936
00:42:41,103 --> 00:42:42,836
That's it?

937
00:42:42,871 --> 00:42:44,471
Well, it shouldn't be too hard

938
00:42:44,506 --> 00:42:46,640
to track down a single errant soul.

939
00:42:46,675 --> 00:42:48,175
(chuckles)

940
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:50,344
(fingernails clinking glass)

941
00:42:54,083 --> 00:42:55,182
You're afraid.

942
00:42:57,252 --> 00:42:58,885
Mmm.

943
00:42:58,921 --> 00:43:00,387
Damn right I am.

944
00:43:00,422 --> 00:43:02,622
Right, but you're never afraid.

945
00:43:02,658 --> 00:43:04,858
Who could possibly scare you, brother?

946
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:10,497
Lucifer...

947
00:43:10,532 --> 00:43:13,533
Who escaped Hell?

948
00:43:18,045 --> 00:43:19,572
Mum.
