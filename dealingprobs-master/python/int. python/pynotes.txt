generator = (i for i in range(200))
list_comprehension = [i for i in range(200)]
generator is way too faster coz it doesnt save that

[print(i) for i in xyz]
print([*xyz])

timeit module
put all the codes in timeit.timeit("""here""",number = no of times)

in list comprehensionu canu se the some variable and it will not be stored
but in regular for loop it is stored and overwrite the orignal value
