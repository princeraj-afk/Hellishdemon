generator = (i for i in range(200))
list_comprehension = [i for i in range(200)]
generator is way too faster coz it doesnt save that

[print(i) for i in xyz]
print([*xyz])

timeit module
put all the codes in timeit.timeit("""here""",number = no of times)

in list comprehension u can use the some variable and it will not be stored
but in regular for loop it is stored and overwrite the orignal value

next(x)//x.__next__() for skipping iteration in a iterator

logging.debug("code")
logging.info("code")
logging.warning("code")
logging.error("code")
logging.critical("code")

its better
logging.basicConfig(filename = "",level = logging.warning)

import json
k = json.dumps(dictionary) => convert into json string
p = json.loads(k) => convert back into dict

from multiprocessing import Pool
p = Pool()
result = p.map(function,array)
p.close()
p.join()

to get size of anything
sys.getsizeof()
